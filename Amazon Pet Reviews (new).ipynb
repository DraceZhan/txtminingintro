The 3 yr old cat was fascinated for about 15 minutes but when the same pictures came on, she got bored.  The 5 year old watched for about a few minutes but then walked away. It is possible that because we have a wonderful courtyard full of greenery and trees and one of my neighbors has a bird feeder, that there is enough going on outside that they prefer real life versus a taped version.  I will more than likely pass this on to a friend who has cats that don't have as much wildlife to watch as mine do.\",\n",

I read all the reviews, and knew that vol. two was the best, hands down, but for few extra dollars I decided to get all three in a combo pack.  Since birds are a natural source of food for cats (feral) it was natural that they were instantly attracted to vol. two. Contrary to all the cartoons, cats are not fishermen, and thus, fish, either in a bowl or in the wild are not something they are naturally attracted to. Since gerbils and guinea pigs are not native where I live, they could have been little dogs as far as my cats could tell. Rodents are also a natural food, so volume one was much better than volume three. Also, the quality could have been better (for my eyes only) but my cats could care less about video quality... they just see birds..  LOL',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Tried a couple other products before this, but this the only one that has worked.  I have two dogs and the second one started this habit and taught it to our first dog.  So disgusting!  As suggested by others we doubled the dosage and so far (about six months plus) it's been working I would say about 90% of the time (that we can tell).My husband and I work long hours so they are in our side yard (about 15 x 45) for many hours by themselves with a door to the garage.  Though we walk them in the morning and then check the side yard for any deposits before we leave for work, before using this product, it was not uncommon for us to come home to dogs with horrible breath and a side yard of half-eaten piles.  We also had a dog walker come 2-3 times a week in the middle of the day to walk them again (and pick up any piles) to alleviate this problem.  However, we still ecountered this problem rather frequently.  The poor dogs really suffered for it too because we didn't want them anywhere near us at night because they smelled so disgusting.With this product, we believe that the habit has stopped, if not all the way, at least to a significant degree.  Other than I think twice in the last six months, we now come home to dogs that don't gross us out with their bad breath anymore.  And everyone is much happier for it.One more thing:  Our first dog was starting to get finicky with his food.  I don't know if this powder was to blame or if it's a supplement that we also give to him.  But what I found out works really well are those liver biscotti sprinkles.  Just adding a bit of those to the top of his dry dog food really helps with his finishing his food.  (The second dog is a food inhaler so she's got no problem with anything we give her or add to her food.)\",\n",

We just have one other dog, her brother. She immediately began ingesting feces from both her and her brother. I'm not sure if this is a habit from living with many other dogs or was brought on by the stress of being in a new home, but I was determined to stop it.We tried a product from Drs. Foster and Smith called Distaste and it worked quite well, but my male dog wasn't terribly thrilled with it-- it came in chew form and he didn't seem to like them. So I found this SEP and was glad to see it's something mixed into their food. It does not work as well as the Distaste, but seems to discourage her. All winter I have noticed my female picking up frozen specimens and marching around the yard with them... but she doesn't seem to be eating them. I plan to double the dose, as some other reviewers have noted, and we'll see how things go through the spring. We are typically quick about cleaning up after them, particularly now that we can see the ground, but occasionally we miss a pile. I'm hoping that the problems we had this winter with the SEP not working well were maybe because the feces were frozen, and now that things are thawing, maybe the SEP will discourage her more strongly.So bottom line, it seems to be working fairly well, but has not broken the habit completely. My only other comment is the smell of the product itself. It smells like Pixie Stick dust, or something similarly sweet/sour and I find the smell really awful. My husband and two sons don't seem to mind, but I hold my breath until I get it mixed into the dogs' food.\",\n",

A couple problems: the hook at the top slides around the short section of wire on the cage that it hooks on (maybe an inch total).  Just means that it doesn't sit perfectly level.  The problem with that is that the birds don't like sitting on the downward-sloping part, so they only use the upward sloping part.  I'm going to try modding it so the hook isn't detachable and doesn't slide, but just stays in the middle so it's level.  The other issue is that the birds don't like sitting on the front/back of the suet cage, I think because it moves around a lot when they land, but every time they try it, there's a lot of wing flapping for a few seconds before they give up and use the other feeder.  This might get better with time.  If it does, I will update this review.  For now, I would say it's so-so for a suet feeder.  I've been looking at nicer more expensive ones, but I'll give this another month (and update this review!)UPDATE: The feeder made it through the season, but I don't think I'd buy again.  Not even sure if I'll put it out next year.  I have another feeder that has space for suet on each side.  That suet gets eaten REALLY quickly, while the one in the cage lasts long enough to start molding (several weeks).  They do eat the one in the cage, and maybe would use it more if I didn't have better alternatives right there.  For the price it's ok I guess, but I don't think I'd buy again.\",\n",

I was pleased to find a matching one on Amazon as I now have more to store.  (I subscribe to Amazon premium dry dog foods, which is both a great bargain and convenience). Yes, some of the food can tumble out when the bin is full and you have the bin positioned as shown. If you turn it so that the door is on top, the problem is solved.  My dogs cannot get into these containers, nor do vermin. I have found them very durable, and you can clean them as you like every so often with bleach or alcohol or whatever product you prefer.  One of the main reasons that I like these is that they are actually pleasant to look at. You can also open the door with one hand.  I have small dogs, so food lasts fairly long.  If I had larger dogs, I would probably opt for a larger container.  I have just ordered another from Amazon.  Until I read the reviews, I had not considered using them for anything but dogfood - but I might consider how they could help me with other storage needs.My package just arrived, and much to my disgust it contained a Bergen storage bin (doesn't match) in a color that it ugly to me.

       "  'reviewText': 'The Good Stuff: My cats love this litter box. When I\\'m cleaning it they pace around me like a child waiting for their teddy bear to come out of the wash. When I had one cat the bin needed to be emptied once a week. Now with 2 it\\'s more like every 3 days. I line the bin with a little trash bag and it works great. No need to buy the expensive receptacles. Every so often I\\'ll have to use the special litter scoop that comes with it to scrape some \"left over\" off the rake. It does make a noise but it\\'s not that loud. I recommend leaving it in a closet or laundry room. Guests always ask why my boiler room is making noise. The noise doesn\\'t bother my cats, they actually come running to watch it work. It is, however, the only litter box they\\'ve ever known.The Catch: I bought the box in April and had no problems until late October when I realized the box was getting very full. The censors had stopped working. I called their customer service, who\\'s pre-recorded message makes you think you\\'ve called the wrong number (they start talking about tools), and spoke with some friendly but not 100% knowledgeable people. They gave me all kinds of instructions on how to fix it myself like dusting off the censors, \"re-setting\" the box by clicking the switches 10 times each, etc. All of these things I tried as they are in the instructions but I humored them. Finally they gave me instructions on how to get a new box so now I\\'m in the process of mailing the wire that powers the rake, the battery compartment cover, my receipt, and $10 so I can get a new one. I\\'m not too happy that I had to destroy my box with no guarantee they will send me a new one but I understand why they make you do it.The Moral of the Story: Nothing makes a cat happier than a clean littler box and now that it\\'s broken I simply can\\'t keep it clean enough for them (in their opinions). I\\'m going to get the replacement and use it until it breaks too but I think I\\'m going to look into the toilet training kit.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I gave 5 stars because i\\'ve had three Litter Maids over about 12-13 years and have always been very grateful not to have to clean the catbox--i was able to forget about it for at least a couple of weeks at a time, sometimes much more. I have only one small cat.  You can\\'t beat not having to think about the catbox, it\\'s almost like not having one at all--compared to the old fashion litter box.I first saw the Litter Maid in the LA Times Magazine around 1995, there was a full page ad, and you could pay in three installments, it was expensive, at least a couple hundred.  Catbox scooping depressed me so i ordered one.  Mine worked right out of the box.it\\'s always tricky putting the right amount of litter in.  If i put too much, it just keeps recycling and raking until i take some out.  Following the instructions, i found that there would be too much litter and the machine would malfunction, but if i put it lower than the limit line, it would be fine.I had some kind of technical problem in the beginning, i can\\'t remember what, and was pleased with their tech support, they took care of me, way back then.After a few years, it stopped working and i gladly got another one.  At some point, i began using Litter Pearls cat litter in it when that first came out.  That was yet another technical advance for my situation.  The Litter Pearls absorbed the urine so there was less stuff getting scooped into the box, and i was able to go even longer without being reminded of the litter box.In the beginning, Litter Pearls was just regular little round pearls. Then, my pet store came out with \"lite tracking litter pearls\" which were not round. They made them irregular shaped and rough, to prevent tracking i guess. That new light tracking style did not agree with my Litter Maid.  It was too granular and it jammed up the mechanism.  My pet store stopped carrying the regular non-lite tracking kind of Litter Pearls, so i had to search for an alternative.The combination of those little round litter balls and the Litter Maid did great things for my quality of life.  I did not want to go backwards into using the old fashioned kind of litter. I was ready to buy the regular Litter Pearls from the company in another state, (i called around) if necessary, or on eBay, but i was able to find another brand that had the round balls in a local store, the brand is Litter Secret, i couldn\\'t find the product on the web though.As long as i had the little round ball litter, not the lite tracking kind, my Litter Maid performed consistently.  The second one lasted several more years with never a mechanical problem.  Long ago, i got the tent. I would always use a tent with the Litter Maid.  For me, the less evidence of a litter box the better.The Litter Maid rake did not clean easily and with my policy of not paying a lot of attention to the litter box, eventually the second Litter Maid got messy and the price had come way down on them, so i decided rather than clean it, i\\'d just get a new one.  the motor was still working fine, there was no problem with it after several years. I just didn\\'t feel like cleaning it, was working lots of overtime and my job and felt i could afford a new one. I\\'ve had the third one for several more years, it has been very low maintenance, no mechanical problems, i just have cleaned it every few weeks, i\\'m not sure how often, maybe 2 weeks, maybe more, it seems long between times when i have to deal with it.Recently it stopped working.  The light was on but without warning, it wouldn\\'t become active, it just sat there.I got a Litter Robot to replace it, because of the great reviews and decided i would try a change, since LItter Robot will let you return it for 60 days.  I\\'m still evaluating the Litter Robot, but there are some things that so far, i like better about the Litter Maid, one is, i didnt\\' have to regularly clean the Litter Maid, just take out the plastic containers, and then do a big cleaning once in a great while.  I think i\\'m going to have to clean the Litter Robot more often.The Litter Maid plastic containers were easier for me to switch out and replace than the plastic bags for the Litter Robot, less struggle, less time spent bending over the \"dreaded area.\"  And more secure feeling because stiff plastic is thicker than a plastic bag.Being inside the tent, the LItter Maid didn\\'t have anything directly exposed to open air, whereas the Robot sits there with its door open and litter sitting out there in contact with the rest of the world.  Having said all of that, the LItter Robot is very cool.  More ingenious than the LItter Maid.  anyone could dream up the LItter Maid.  It would take a special kind of mind to think up the Litter Robot.  Watching it do its thing is something to behold, in terms of human engineering.  I was very happy with the LItter Maid, my three worked reliably and flawlessly each one for many years.  I didn\\'t have to deal with tech support.  But again, i had only one small cat.Oh, i almost forgot. My cat always liked to use only one side of the Litter Maid, so the waste would pile up on one end of the plastic container, causing it to fill up faster, only on that side, than it would if it had been distributed evenly.  When it fills up and doesn\\'t close completely, that\\'s when i can smell it and i go into action to change the container, but i alway would find that half the container wasn\\'t used, it was empty on one side, full on the other. This never affected the mechanical performance of the Litter Maid itself.Update:  10/3/10I have just retired my most recent Litter Maid which i started using a year ago.  I was having a very hard time with it.  It worked well as far as the motor and everything it\\'s supposed to do, but the problem  was with the litter (crystals). The crystals were getting saturated in only about 4 days and if i didn\\'t change the litter, my cat would pee on the floor cover that i kept under the litter maid.  That is way too frequent to have to deal with cat sewage, by my standards.  Urine was getting all over the box and under the box. I thought the litter maid was leaking but couldn\\'t find any openings.  It took me a long time to figure out that my cat\\'s hyperthyroid condition was causing her to excessively urinate.  When i realized it, about two months ago, i doubled her medication and the problem has gone away. but she continued to refuse to use the Litter Maid, i think it must\\'ve developed an odor because of all the urine all over it, i tried to wipe it off but far from perfectly i\\'m sure.  Even though the crystals weren\\'t saturated at all, she was peeing on the floor cover.  So i have just replaced the Litter Maid with a ScoopFree automatic box. So far it\\'s working great. I took the Litter Maid outside, cleaned it as best i could with diluted Simple Green spray, it looks ok, i put it some big plastic bags and will keep it in the garage.  It has been working very well.  A real trooper.I want to say that i appreciate the Litter Maid, it served me well for about 16 or more years, about 5 of them over those years, two were thrown out not because they wore out but because they were dirty so in my experience they have worked well. I never had a problem with the motors, and i was always impressed at the way it just kept raking over and over, never giving out.This is different from some peoples\\' experience.  I want say that i have always used Litter Pearls crystals in the litter Maid, not clay or clumping litter, and that may be why i haven\\'t had the same problems some have had.  I would recommend using crystal litter with it, but in my experience, it had to be the rounded kind, not the trackless/lite tracking kind which are irregularly shaped.  The trackless kind were too abrasive and jagged for the litter maid, they jammed it up, causing the rake to come to a painful creaking halt in mid cycle. But the rounded ones work well, they just aren\\'t easy to find because people tend to prefer lite tracking litter.  But other than that, the crystals have always worked great in the Litter Maid.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'We have from two to four cats at a time in our home, and managing the litter box is something we want to be as easy as possible. This LitterMaid LM500 Automated Litter Box was the first automated solution we tried. I\\'m afraid it wasn\\'t our last, as it had numerous problems.First, the tines would get clumped full of stuff and it would get caked solid rather quickly. I\\'ll note that we didn\\'t even try having this be the \"only\" litter box in our home! We had two others there too. We just wanted to see how well this worked. The storage container would get jammed in the open position, so that it did not do a good job of managing stench.However, we could have dealt with those issues. We could have cleaned the tines daily, and pushed down the lid ourselves regularly. The real problem was far more serious.First, understand how this works. The system sense motion and then X minutes after the cat has left the area, the tines move across, dragging any solids and clumps with it, pushing those items into the receptacle plastic box at the far end. Then the tines return to their original position and wait for a new visit.What happened with our unit would be that the tines would decide that they were ALWAYS ON and would keep going back and forth, back and forth, driving the poor kitties to distraction. There was no way they were going to jump in there and try to do their business while a set of metal tines was growling towards them!We tried several times to fix this, but it really just wasn\\'t worth it. We moved on to other options and found a GREAT one. This one went in the trash as we couldn\\'t even imagine subjecting any other cat owner to it. A large waste of money.Not well recommended.I\\'ll give it 2/5 stars on the assumption that some units do NOT do that random motion thing - but it would only take one fritz in a lifetime to really demolish a cat\\'s desire to ever use the unit again :)',\n",

In fact, it is cheaper to just use a coventional litter pan and throw away the whole thing litter and all instead of using the refuse containers as throw away items.  The lids will fall off and need to be taped in place.My unit burned out when one of the cats pulled out the power cord at the end of the unit.  It just kept getting fuller and fuller and I was gone for a few days.  Even though it is supposed to be protected from running when blocked, when I returned I found the unit almost extended to the refuse bin and the stupid wire which hangs out in the middle of the box had been tangled by one of the poor cats trying to use the unit when it broke.

I mean cleaning completely, with a new coat of scotch-guard on the pan surface and fresh litter refilled.And that may not make a difference if you have a cat that aims for the plastic tines. And cleaning those is kinda nasty. I've noticed that a new version is out with metal tines.  Maybe the manufacturer's cat had good aim too.Since writing the review below we got a cat with exceptional aim. He could jam up that thing in one session. We were cleaning it every day, and finally opted this year to get a plain old deep rectangular litter pan with scoopable litter and ditch the Litter Maid.  Heck - we were in cleaning it everyday anyway due to our 'artistic' new cat.---------------------------------------I have three cats, all indoor, and you can imagine I've tried about every kind of litter to come up with something workable for both me and the cats.I've had a LitterMate (the larger size) for almost a year now and think this is the next best thing to sliced bread. we liked it so well, we've recently gotten the regular sized one as well since the cats were giving the one we had such a workout.Pros:Our dogs no longer go litter-diving for 'snacks'. The mechanism scares them and most of the contents are now hidden away in the plastic container.The cats are only fascinated by the workings of the litterbox and had no problem adjusting. The oldest was 6, the youngest 5 months.Scoopable litter + three cats previously meant 2-3 times a day  scooping the litterbox. One LitterMate + three cats = 2-3 times a week tray dumping.  The trays are easily reused, making them more economical.The box itself has been dumped and cleaned every other month. The comb is held in place by two screws and is easily removed from the engine to be cleaned. I soak the bottom pan and comb in an antibacterial  cleaner solution, and after it's dry use Scotchguard on both.The house I live in is small - there are few places to hide litterbox odor. This does it effectively.One of our cats like to dig his way to China when he covers his stuff.  I was worried that the scratches on the bottom of the pan would cause more sticking than normal, but a generous coating of Scotchguard keeps things moving along in spite of the battle scars in the LitterMaid.Cons:Yes - litter does escape underneath a little, but with the activities of three cats we were always vaccuming around the litter box anyway - no difference there.The litter flinging problem happened once to me - every time afterwards I threw the garbage bag on top of the tray while I removed it, then just tipped it into the bag. Again, no biggie.Tips:Those lines in the litterbox aren't kidding - don't fill the box over the red line, or the motor will jam.When they say Premium clumping litter, they mean it.  The alternative is a constantly jammed motor.Whenever you empty the tray, pass the scraper through the pan to make sure that nothing escaped the comb along the bottom. Those spots can build up and cause a jam too.If stuff sticks too often to the comb or bottom, it usually means it's time to dumb the entire box and clean and re-coat it with nonsitck spray. Not the non-stick spray used in cooking either.\",\n",

It should not have been that difficult to make a better fitting plastic box or area where it is to be placed.A second problem is that the red \"fill\" line is misleading. If litter is filled up to that point (or even fairly close to it) the machine jams. As a result, to prevent jamming, one needs to fill the device with far below its full capacity. This, in turn, necessitates filling the machine with more cat litter than should be the case (i.e., twice a week instead of once).A third problem is that the rakes, many times, get jammed due to filling up with litter. The rakes should have been made further apart to reduce this.In short, the machine does do its job but with a few relatively minor modifications (that should have been easy to spot for the manufacturer) this machine could have been much improved._______________________________Update:After less than one year machine breaks down and needs to be replaced. Tech support provided by company of very limited use in even determining how (possibly) to fix the problem (assuming it can be to begin with). Hence a one star product.',\n",

Never could get rake to work, Littermaid customer service (once you finally get to is) was of little help and Orange Onion (don't buy anything from them) sucked. They couldn't care less, at least Littermaid apologized (on one of my three calls). Keep in mind, if you buy it and return it, do it through Littermaid. You only need to send back the battery cover and that blasted pull wire. To get that out ( NO help from Littermaid!), unscrew every single screw and once you get your hands on that wire, don't let it go! Or you have to take out the rest of the screws by the battery compartment. I wasted hours and hours on this. If only they had a good competitor.

       "  'reviewText': 'I bought the largest LitterMaid off of Ebay in Jan 2003 from a Seller called KittenKaboodle. It took a few trials to find a litter that worked well but I settled on Scoop Away. Yes, as some reviewers have mentioned, sometimes it does stick to the bottom and you will have to use the scooper to scrape it up or clean the rakes sometimes. Then, I just turn it on and off and it will rake everything up.  It only takes me a few seconds to check for any stuck spots or even out the litter, turn it on and off to make it rake and then add a little new litter to the top (so the cats think it\\'s nice and clean). :-) It\\'s not completely \"no work\" but it is a lot less work than a \"manual\" litterbox and stays smelling cleaner than manual boxes.  I do use larger plastic grocery bags in the receptacle. It\\'s a lot cheaper than throwing away receptacles every 3-4 days and it\\'s alot easier to clean. Believe me, I do not like trying to pry those receptacles out when it is completely full.  You have to stick your fingers inside to grab onto it (YUCK!) and it\\'s heavy and hard to get out sometimes dumping litter and stuff all over the place (double YUCK).The Seller on Ebay was selling the one I bought with a \"super charged\" motor (which is in the electrical cord). It worked pretty good for almost a year. Apparently, unlike the \"normal motor\", the stronger motor kept it from resetting sometimes when it would hit clumps that were too big for it.  It would attempt to plow right thru which sounds like a good thing, but it wasn\\'t. Apparently the gears and/or sprokets which move the rake along are made of plastic and within a year they were stripped. It started out making a spinning sound once in awhile but would eventually go ahead and rake. One day I came home to a god awful sound. I found the rake stuck right in the middle of the box, gears just spinning and making a heck of a racket. This was enough to scare away ALL 4 cats from the ONLY litterbox. Needless to say we had some accidents. 3 of my cats \"recovered\" and would go back to the disconnected box, but my 20 year old cat was traumatized and refused to use it. So I had to set up the manual box. I\\'m STILL working with her trying to get her to stop going elsewhere because of this.I took the Littermaid to a repair shop and they knew immediately that the gears were stripped because they\\'d seen it before. They said they couldn\\'t repair it because they couldn\\'t get parts.I contacted the Ebay Seller who said it was still under warranty. I had to pay shipping to and from the Seller though which was not cheap. The 2nd supercharged Littermaid started doing the same thing after less than 6 months and the Seller says this one is not under warranty. Apparently, the warranty does not extend to the replacement that they sent me which I think is a rip-off considering how expensive these things are.While the 1st Littermaid was being repaired, I went ahead and bought another \"regular\" (not supercharged) Littermaid from Petsmart. I\\'ve had it 8 months and had no skipping problems so far. I think the \"supercharged\" motor caused all my problems, but KittenKaboodle refuses to acknowledge this and refused to warranty the 2nd box that they sent me.So, overall it\\'s great when it works, but it could use a few improvements. The bottom of the pan needs to be made of something more \"non-stick\" so the rake can get thru some of the larger wet spots and/or the gears need to be made of something stronger to be able to take a stronger motor that can get thru the stuck on clumps (and not strip the gears). Also I would like to see a slightly larger receptacle on the larger models. They are made for a multi cat household but with only one litterbox it fills up pretty fast. With 2 litterboxes it\\'s not too bad though. I would also like to see some sort of hood like other auto litterboxes that I\\'ve seen. That tent seems like a nuisance (it looks like it would block the on/off switch and collect litter in the box.)',\n",

I also traveled quite a bit for work and liked the idea of the box cleaning itself while I was gone.The overall idea is good, and the cats used it with no adjustment. It seemed to work well when the tracks stayed clean, but...my male cat insisted on peeing in corners of the end where the motor and rake are. Then he kicked the damp litter up behind the rake mechanism and into the tracks the rake uses. The litter would clog the tracks so the rake would get stuck, and the litter behind the rake unit prevented it from returning all the way back. Cleaning it out seemed to only encourage him to do it again!They need to come up with a way to shield the rake and tracks from the litter or at least clean the tracks as it cleans the litter.If your cat(s) go in the middle of the box like they are \"supposed\" to this is a good product, albeit a bit expensive to use.

I liked the idea that I no longer would have to worry about having to scoop out cat waste or have a strong cat waste smell in my home.  I bought the LM920 which I found to have a quiet and decent motor. Unfortunately, it only lasted about three years.  Then I bought the LM900 as the LM920 was no longer made even though it is superior to the LM900 and quieter.  The first LM900 I bought lasted about a year and half, and I found the motor noisy and not very sturdy.  The second LM900 lasted about a year.  I bought the third LM900 and it only lasted two days before the rake stopped in the dumping into the receptacle mode and wouldn't move anymore.  I had to unscrew the rake so I could empty the receptacle which was full of lovely cat waste, dump the current amount of cat litter and return it to Amazon so I could get a replacement.  The replacement one broke also with the rake in the upright position so again, I had to unscrew the rake to get to the almost full receptacle to dump it out. Don't bother buying the Littermaid LM900 model as it is obviously doesn't last.  I went and bought the latest version of the Littermaid which is a LME9000 and it is better with a timer so the rake doesn't run during during a 9 hour duration but I still run into the rake getting stuck at various times and it also pushes unused litter into the receptacle.  I go through way more litter now which is frustrating but it does seem to have a stronger motor.\",\n",

My only complaint with this thing is that sometimes it scoops litter onto the floor but hey, that's what brooms are for!  We have ours in the basement so that really isn't much of a factor regarding the litter spillage.  However, I do still keep out a regular box just because ours likes to do one in one box, and the other in another box.  I'm tempted to get two of these Littermaids just so I don't have to worry about changing the other box!Ours gets clumps on the rake as well when our boy likes to urinate on it, but I just use a regular cat scooper and scrape it off.  Also, those refills are tremendously expensive so I do as the previous reviewer and just reuse them, fill them with a deodorizer (baking soda works great and it's cheap!), and voila!  I've not had any trouble with mine getting so full that I couldn't get it out to empty.

Primarily I bought them after I adopted a rescue kitten - who as it turned out, has the coronavirus that can cause Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP). Some apparently healthy cats may carry the virus which can be shed intermittently in bodily fluids or feces, with feces being the most common source of oral infection.She is completely healthy by all other standards - but if she or the other two catch a cold, or feel stressed etc., this coronavirus can surface. Much like a herpes virus in humans. And like the herpes virus it is easily transmitted. With cats the primary method that they transmit illness to each other is through feces.With the LitterMaid automatic box - the potential for all the cats to  step on or otherwise put a nose to each other's waste is almost completely eliminated. (with 2 boxes - I have never seen one cat go into a box right after a cat has used it. - They go to the other one, which is clean and ready for their use)And because I can work some very long hours. 16-18 hrs some days. I feel a bit more assured knowing the box is keeping itself clean.It does take a bit to get used to as far as the noise of the rake and what it takes to do a through clean.  But, as I like them so much for what they do that I don't mind the maintenance. Which isn't as involved as it would seem. It's actually rather simple to clean with a wet handrag and the occasional vacuum or dustbuster (which can be said of almost all litter boxes)Another advantage -- you don't need much litter and it goes much further.You do need to use a premium letter (I use 'the World's Best Litter') - but because it lasts as long as it does, it is a financial bargain.\",\n",

If I waited for the second day, the container would overfill, sometimes because all the clumps were on the same side, keeping the lid open (you can imagine the smell)Finally, my youngest cat has a very fragile stomach. Well let me tell you, the raking process is not designed to handle runny poo. This was the last drop in the bucket, which prompted me to do some research on the web. Six months ago, I bought the litter-robot (litter-robot dot com), and my two cats and I couldn't be more satisfied.In summary, the LitterMaid is great if you only have one cat who never gets the runs. Otherwise, the Litter-Robot is a much better choice (but it costs twice as much)\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'In a household with three adult cats I was constantly cleaning the litter box.  With the Littermaid LM900 I need only empty or replace the waste container about twice a week.  The litter is kept clean and smoothed by the automatic raking action.  Odors are minimal since waste is stored in a closed container and the exposed litter is continually cleaned.  Make sure you only use premium, clumping litter.  That\\'s the good news.Now for the not so good news.  The unit is noisy with a capital \"N\".  Don\\'t plan on placing it near the living spaces in your home if you value your peace and quiet.  Waste frequently lodges between the teeth on the rake so I\\'m finding myself visually checking anytime I\\'m near the unit and using my scoop to clear the rake.  About every other day I need to use the scoop to scrape along the bottom of the pan to loosen anything sticking to the bottom so the rake can catch it on the next pass.  Lastly, the included ramp which is supposed to keep your cat from tracking litter is a joke.  It simply isn\\'t big enough and my cats usually jump over it rather than walk down it.  To solve the problem, I continue to leave a small area rug in front of the unit.  That seems to catch about 75% of the tracked litter. the unit isn\\'t cheap.  Taking into account the noise and the other problems, I would still buy the unit if I had to do it over again primarily for the conveninence.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"This is my second Littermaid.  My first worked great but my cat died so I sold it on Ebay.  However, it always worked well but you have to use the correct litter or the Littermaid will not work as advertised.  I never had a problem with the motor failing or other issues I've read in these reviews.  I also read that if the motor jams there is a reset that many user may not know about and this may be a reason for so many returns.  Once again in the year I used it the motor never stopped working.  The box is a bit noisy so I wouldn't suggest setting this in a bedroom.  Also, there is a chance that the rake moving and noise may scare your cat and they will not want to use it. Try setting it up with the power off for a few days and then turn it on after the cat gets use to using the box. The only other issue is that there is a raking motion that pushes all the waste forward but it also pushes good litter with it so the end result is good litter gets dumped into the plastic bin.  I had the option of buying the newer unit but read so many bad reviews that I decided to go for one of the older models.  I also build a table with a hole in it.  Then I cut out the bottom of the plastic container that catches the waste.  Now the unit dumps the waste into a 13 gallon trash bag and I can go quite a while without emptying it.  With the stock container you can go about 3 days with one cat.  If I wasn't setting up the table and larger bag I would look more closely at the Smart Scoop.  It seems to waste less litter.\",\n",

I could not possible keep up with cleaning the litter and this sure helps me out a lot. We bought the permanent chute from Litterworks and my husband used an old entertainment center we got for next to nothing at goodwill and it fits 2 littermaids comfortably. If you look at littermaid disposal system at amazon[...] you will see what it sort of looks like. I love the LM9000 but I would agree the LME9000 (elite with the ionic air cleaner) does not work well and it gives littermaid a bad name. If you can find the basic ones I think they work better than the ionic air cleaner ones. We only empty our litter a couple of times a weeks as once it goes down the chute into the trash bag we only have to take the trash bag out. No, it does not smell, I also add a little baking soda to the trash bag but you do have to clean the littermaid occasionally just like any other litterbox, just not as much. I use Worlds Best Litter (corn litter) makes littermaid work easier and cuts down on the dust from litter. It is a shame that the elite's have sullied the littermaid product name. I hope they improve on it as I would like to buy a backup in case one of mine goes (I figure after 3 yrs it's due) but I won't buy another elite with the ionic (read moronic) air cleaner.\",\n",

This stresses the motor out to were it resets itself, thus not scooping anything.  Or if it does break through it, the clump crumbles to small enough pieces where it slips through the scooper and quickly starts to stink.  I tried five different types of litter, nothing improved the machines performance.  I ended up keeping a hand scooper and plastic bags available as I had to scoop and clean it myself.  The plastic mounts on the scooper ended up snapping of after two months of use.  The box is just messy and useless and hard to wash as you have to disassemble it. You might as well buy litter tray for $5, it will function 100 times better.  I use a plastic concrete mixing tray you can get at home depot for $6.

That being said I've found a few things are necessary to do to make it work at its best:1) Use Littermaid litter. Is more expensive but I don't have to constantly throw all of it out so I think I break even. It clumps perfectly and I get very few leavings.2) Empty the recepticals when they are half full. This will help avoid the vile spatter and spilling. Alternatively, seal the top down before taking out the bottom section and then pull the whole thing out, empty it and then put the old set back (I definitely reuse them).3) Don't bother with the tent. It's huge, the opening isn't wide enough to fully open the litter cover when you go to empty it and if your cat is as vigorous as mine at covering the litter, it will get in between the box and tent and is hard to clean. I find the height of the littermaid is enough that he doesn't fling litter out the back or sides, just occasionally over the litter recepticle when it's getting too full.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'UPDATE:11/25/2008 The literbox broke down (I believe it may have been due to a thunder/lightening storm we had) and it has no power. I called Littermaid. They told me that it was under their one year warranty. They asked me to cut the white power cord on the rake and return it to them which I did. Within a week they sent me out a brand new litterbox. I am very pleased. Best Customer Service Ever! A+++++I should tell you that I\\'ve had this litter box before..About 6 years ago I had 3 cats and bought one of these litter boxes to save my sanity and my back. At the time that I purchased it, it SUGGESTED (NOT REQUESTED)that you use premium cat litter. At that time I saw it as a marketing ploy to get me to buy premium cat litter so I disregarded their suggestion..Bad mistake... It was clogging at least once a week but at the time I still considered this to be nothing considering the fact that I wasnt having to scoop anymore. I had that unit for about 2 and 1/2 years and then it died on me. I still think I got a good deal out of it though.So recently I bought the same litter box again only this time it REQUIRES  you to use the premium cat litter so I bought the \"scoop away\" cat litter at the supermarket. This litter is supposed to be better than the regular litter because it is more absorbent than the regular and it clumps and drys more quickly than the traditional kitty litter. Since the Littermaid Litter box rakes the litter 10 minutes after the cat leaves, you need a litter that can clump and dry quickly. Well, now I get this! Since I bought the litter box (2 weeks ago) I havent had any clogs and am actually using less Kitty litter than before since it clumps so well.The litterbox is turnkey provided you use the premium kitty litter. I am really glad I bought this product. I am happy...Oh, another point, MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THE KITTY LITTER LEVEL BELOW THE SUGGESTED LINE. I have learned that the machine works harder (and breaks more frequently) if you put too much kitty litter in it. I keep the litter a little below the line. This works great.',\n",

I had very little difficulty training the cats to use the new box; I just followed the simple instructions that came with the Littermaid.  The only difficulty I had in getting the cats accustomed to the new box was a teenager who thought it hillarious to yell boo at a cat as it watched the box clean itself.  Needless to say, that cat took a little longer getting used to the LitterMaid and the teenager got the privelege of cleaning the old box.Just as it advertises, 10 minutes after use, the &quot;sifter&quot; runs from one end of the box to the other, lifting the clumps and depositting them in the container at the end.  A few times it had a little difficulty with a very large clump and I heard it reverse and try again several times before successfully completing the trip.  I do have a problem with litter being dumped on the floor, either by an energetic cat or the sifter pushing litter in front of a clump and over the edge.Don't start thinking this will reduce how often you have to deal with a litter box.  You still have to empty the container daily, add/rearrange the litter daily and probably vacuum frequently.  It misses the really small clumps so you'll have to sift once in a while.  However, it only takes a minute to do these tasks and it really keeps down the smell.  In addition, your kitties are using a much cleaner litter box which is better for them!\",\n",

I have yet to find a cat that will not use this box. My cats at home are all over 10 years old. At the farm they are 2 years and younger. Hope this helps.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"So here it is, the miracle product??? Yes and no... If you still are willing to maintain a litterbox every couple days yes... If you are not willing to do this, it won't help much to get this type litterbox.  My years of previous experience with cats and boxes have proved quite informative so I'll try to give you the low down and insight that hopefully will help.First, multi cat homes need checked daily, not necessarily changed, just checked.  A large cat can't aim the center of the box, especially portly cats.  They being large cats end up hitting the very end of the litter area with urine then the machine sweeps and it then clings a clump stuck to the plastic.  This only happens once in a while when the cat is facing the machine area and his hind end toward the hopper.  Otherwise, the other reason is a not totally clumped chunk of whatever that gets caught in the teeth then rides back to the original position where it dries and then becomes like concrete.  A good brand of litter helps cure some of those problems.Through trial and error, Everclean litter is a great alternative to the brand that littermaid sells ... sold in pet store and amazon.If you have dogs, place the unit with the hopper away from where your dog can pull it out.  My basset hounds would get the notion to dine and pulled the hopper out and it wasn't a pretty site.  I don't have them anymore that was years ago they did that but the memory is still there!Lastly, this LM900 is a bit quieter than the original, battery life is NOT what they say... two months is not ever going to happen.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'This cat box is a lifesaver. My vet recommended trying this when a Persian of mine started having issues of straying from the box. The vet said that some cats are just extra fastidious and no matter how many times a day a person scoops the box as long as there is anything at all in the box they will refuse to use it.I was hesitant at first to get this, fearing that the cat would be frightened of the motor and would become even more traumatized by the litter box. With great trepidation, I set the LitterMaid up, and from that moment on, there has never been a single instance of the cat straying from the box to do his business.Some people say that a motorized cat box is a waste of money, but it is well worth trying if you face a similar dilemma: it can save your sanity and your carpet, and may let some cats stay in loving homes instead of being abandoned or even euthanized.I am absolutely delighted with the LitterMaid, and have had no problems with it, and at this point mine is over two years old. I highly endorse the LitterMaid system.',\n",

We have owned as many as two Litter Maids at one time and experienced the same problem with all of them.  First the solid waste sticks to the forks and is difficult to clean.  Second the trays are expensive and messy to change.  I see where they are now giving you 18 trays for about the same price we were paying for twelve, but at over $1.00 each they are still too much.We recently bought a Scoop Free and are more than happy with it.  It works as advertised and even though the replacement cartridges are expensive, they last a long time and actually cost us less than we were paying for litter alone.  We have now bought a second Scoop Free and find we only use three cartridges a month, and have never had to clean it except for waste that has gotten on the sides that needs to be wiped off, but we would have that problem no matter what type of box we used.If you are thinking about buying an automatic litter box I would suggest you buy the Scoop Free instead of this one.

       "  'reviewText': 'This is my 4th littermaid in about 12-15 years.  I\\'ve always found them to be great, but not very long lived.My littermaids have serviced 2 cats at all times.  So, if you are a single cat house, you could reasonably expect 5-7 years of use from one of these.  The first unit\\'s motor died.  The second, the spring in the power rake\\'s cord broke, and couldn\\'t reel in the cord anymore.  The third (my last) up and died, no warning or otherwise.  Just stopped running.My first Littermaid was the original.  It lasted about 4 years.  The next was the original \"Mega Advance\" and was the best when it was working.  That only lasted about 3-4 years.  The last Mega (not advance) lasted about 5-6 years, but was very noisy.This newer unit seems to be basically the same as the last Mega, but the motor is slightly more quiet and pushes the rake through the box at a faster clip.  Both nice improvements.  The included scoop has tines in it to clean out the rake, a great idea that only took 15 years....I\\'ve never run my Littermaids on batteries, always using the A/C plug.  If the power\\'s out for a few hours, we can survive, or if needed, scoop.If there was a way to make the system a bit more quiet it would be perfect.Tips:1.  Don\\'t over-fill the box.  Use the bottom (add litter) line as the top fill line.  If you fill to the top line, the system will not work as well.  This seems to be the #1 problem people have, adding too much litter.2.  Use a bit of cooking oil spray (Pam) on the bottom of the pan before you fill with litter.  I rarely clean ours, but when I do, I always spray the bottom of the pan and that really helps keep the box cleaner and helps keep the nasty stuff from getting stuck to the bottom.3.  Use high-quality clumping litter.  We get the big tub of Scoop-Away from Costco.  That lasts more than a month for us.4.  Re-use the waste containers.  They each should last a month or more. Just keep using them until they crack when you are removing to dump the contents.  Then replace.  Saves lots of money there.This would be a 5 star if it was just a bit more quiet overall.',\n",

The last two both stopped working after 2 - 3 years.I can't say anything about the long-term reliability of this one, but it's quieter than the others and the motor sounds stronger.Our kitty has some really big, sticky output that the last one would get stuck in and either just sit in stripping out its gears or reverse and run back and forth. This one doesn't even sound like it's straining and just powers through.All the other design defects are still here - primarily that the litter doesn't all land in the waste tub, and if there's a big clump it can land so that the door stands wide open. But a little more power in the motor makes this a much better product.I did have a problem with the specific package we received - it was missing 11 of the 12 waste tubs, the carbon filters, and the little brush. But after a couple back-and-forth emails with Amazon (who offered to accept a return, but kitty had already inaugurated the new one) and Fox International, who makes the litterbox, two packages showed up with all the missing parts, shipped by Fox.

The problem lies in the structure, which is not strong enough to withstand the weight of an average cat. If your cat likes exploring and climbing on top of things like most cats do, the frame will break quickly.If you're minimally handy, you can very easily make yourself a much better structure using PVC piping and joints (they're inexpensive and can be found in the plumbing section of any hardware store). If your cat is heavy and a climber, I would strongly suggest not even bothering with the supplied frame and building your own right away.Another irritating problem is that replacing the waste receptacles is extremely inconvenient when the littermaid is in the tent.All in all, unless you absolutely have to hide the littermaid, this tent is poorly designed and more trouble than it's worth.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"i got my first litter maid so long ago, i saw it advertised in a magazine and ordered it.  Must've been around 1994 or 95.  Not too long after that, i got the tent.  I went through about 3 or 4 Litter Maids in that time, the motors kept working but they got too dirty and it was time for a fresh one, was my thinking.  That one tent outlived all those litter Boxes.  For me, the tent was great, I liked that it was light weight. It wasn't too flimsy, i could always easily unzip it and zip it back.  Sorry to hear the new ones are poorer quality, i hate when that happens. I have ordered one because i am about to start using a Litter Maid again after a couple of years with a Litter Robot, and when i took the tent apart last time, when i got rid of the last Litter Maid, one piece of the frame wouldn't go back on, i don't know why. But i have to say that overall, that one tent i had certainly held up well. My cat is not rough on things so that may be part of my success with this item on my first experience.  At that time, i had recently moved into an apartment that didn't allow pets, but we already had the cat before we moved in so since she is small, quiet and an indoor cat, i thought i would try and see if i could keep her under cover. The tent was perfect. The manager rarely came into my apartment, only for rare repair incidents, and when he would come, i would drap a table cloth over the tent. At worst, if he came in unexpectedly because of an emergency, i don't remember that happening but if it had, the tent itself would not suggest that there was a cat toilet there.  the tent always did a great job of keeping the odor contained. The tent was crucial to my situation and i have good memories of it.  If i'd known they were going to start making a poorer quality tent, i would've saved the other one. It wasn't worn out. Just one piece of the frame came loose and i tried to get it to go back but it wouldn't. I abandoned it too easily probably because i was switching over to the Litter Robot at that time. At first i gave the tent 4 stars just now, but i have to change it to 5 because my tent lasted about 12 years and was still in good shape when i stopped using it, and it really helped me out by minimizing the mess and odor of a cat box, and camouflaged my catbox so that my cover was never blown. I have ordered the current model of the tent and am definitely concerned after reading the bad reviews. It sounds like maybe there is not much quality control and maybe some units are better cut than others. one can only speculate.  i have my fingers crossed.  i will update my review if the assessment changes.10/3/10 UpdateA year ago when i wrote the above, i ordered a new one of these, despite bad reviews.  I wanted the litter Maid to be in a tent, so i ordered it.  It was unusable.  The cover was much too tight for the frame, and it's a really cheap zipper, the little zipper teeth don't mesh together around the whole length of the zipper.I assembled it when i got it and since then, a year ago, it's sat unused in the spare bedroom. It was really diffcult getting it set up because the cover is too tight, but what made it unusable for me is that in order to clean the litter box i need to unzip it partially so i can pull back the tent flaps and get to the litter box.  The zipper is so flimsy and the cover so tight that extreme pressure has to be applied to open or close the zipper, unlike my old original litter maid tent which was tight enough but not a big production to unzip and re-zip. i never even thought about it.  The zipper on the new model i have is so flimsy that it would never hold up under the kind of puilling necessary to open and close it.I just now disassembled it because i'm going to be moving back to my house and i am packing stuff up. It was really hard to unzip and the teeth of the zipper were unmeshed in places.  Very poor.I left the 3 star rating instead of 1 star because the original version of these was so good, lasting a cat's lifetime without problems, i want to give some notice to the fact that it's a good idea with a good design and low cost compared to the fancy litter box disguises, and to the longevity and sturdiness of the original one.  But i would not recommend buying this one, although Amazon will take it back if it's defective so if anyone wants to try it out, your mileage may vary.\",\n",

That tent has finally bit the dust - the fabric had been washed so many times that it was getting holes in the fabric. So I bought a new one. What an enormous mistake. The new ones do not fit the frame in any way, shape or form. I tapped all the connections with a hammer so that they were all tight, and then tried to put the tent on the frame - there is a 1 inch gap between the top and the bottom and they can't be zippered together!!! So I tried to massage it on - moved more fabric to the front, got the zipper started - and the zipper separated. Okay, put the zipper back together and try again - the slider became deformed and would no longer fit onto the zipper pin. The metal slider itself started to come apart. What a horrible piece of unmitigated JUNK. Don't waste your money unless LitterMaid announces a major redesign of their litter tents. It's sad, the first one was flimsy but worked great and fit properly. Someone, somewhere, cut a few too many corners on this product. The hole kit and caboodle is now residing in the trash.\",\n",

Honestly, a piece of plastic for your cat's doo-doo, and a lid.  Give me a break!  Maybe they should charge $10 each for them, maybe they could stay in business with that!  I guess that's where their money stays consistent after you buy the Littermaid box but really!Anyway, with that gripe out of the way, these things work fairly well.  They do get heavy and the doo-doo can spill out if you're not careful, but I just empty mine into one of those plastic grocery store bags, tie it, and dispose of it the night before garbage day. That way, it's not smelling up the garbage, the house, the garage, the garbage man's hands or face, and it just works out very well.  But if you have more than one cat and high usage, then maybe a galvanized can for the disposal of the grocery store bags would be in order if you're emptying it more than once a week.  My cat goes outside sometimes so I don't have as much to worry about smell-wise.  But if I still lived in my apartment with this thing, I'd be emptying the liner contents into the grocery bag and taking it out to the dumpster daily.  It just keeps everyone happy that way.  These things curb the odor some, but not that much.Let's keep our fingers crossed that someone out there can make a better and cheaper widget for this machine.\",\n",

I don't know if that's something on the littermaid itself that should be improved, or the design of these to include a handle of something on each side that sticks up so you can pull a heavy/full one up and out of the box.  I recently tried a petmate that has a reusable plastic receptacle to which you place little baggies made for it, and its very much similar sized to these receptacles. Returned that terrible box and went back to the littermaid but I have a few extra of the baggies and I am going to try putting them into this receptacle.  They are designed to lift out and cover/tie all in one and that's the only thing I liked about the petmate btw.\",\n",

In addition, the tops get crinkled and often don't go up with the little flap that raises it when the sweeper is being used.I've found a solution for both that works for me.  First I tape two of these receptacles together using a clear packing tape.Scotch 3-Inch Core Mailing & Storage Tape, 48 x 50 Millimeter (4 Pack)(Scotch tape comes off too easily) I hold them tightly together and use several pieces of tape in various places around the top.  It then looks like one more substantial receptacle.  I use an old plastic grocery bag like some other people have mentioned so I can reuse it several times and it's less mess.  I then tape the little bubble things that poke through the top of the flap on the litter box and  to the flap.  (On the outside) This holds them in place when the flap goes up during operation.  It eliminates the problem of the receptacle lid not going up with the flap and litter accumulating in front of the box.2/28/09 - I've found a better and neater solution.

It must be a routine, but I do believe in it.  I noticed the formula has gone from White powder to a brownish powder in the capsule.  I'm not sure why, but if they are not 'bleaching' it then I all for that.  I just hope the ingredients are as good if not better.....  Not sure, but so far it seems to be working as it did before.

       "  'reviewText': \"This was recommended by a former pet store employee.  I was talking to her about the diarrhea that my dog was having.  She told me this would work within a day...and I must admit, she was right.  I have 3 dogs, 1 of which is always having normal stools, the second has intermittent diarrhea, and the third always has an issue with soft/loose stools.  I initially tried it on my 2 and it cleared up the diarrhea with the one immediately.  The other one who always had an issue with intermittent loose/watery stools, I had her on another regimen which over time gave her stools form, but it was rather costly and she didn't always like eating it (herbal regimen).  This, however, is very easy for me to give to her as she only requires one capsule of which I open into her bowl and mix with canned dog food then hand feed to make sure she eats it, and she eats it as if it were a treat.  I can then feed her the normal dry kibble in her bowl afterwards.  I am continuing this on a daily regiment with my one dog.  I recommend it.  The price is very reasonable and it is easily dispensed.  I am not certain, but I guess you could also just feed the entire capsule to your dog, but I prefer opening it so I know it will work quickly.Update:  August 2013.  I am now feeding 1 capsule daily to both of my dogs who had  loose stool issues.  Once their stools were firm (within a couple of days of opening capsule and adding to wet food), I am now dispensing the entire capsule and everything is fine.  I have one very finicky senior gal so she will only take her meds with peanut butter (she can't spit it out as I scoop it on the roof of her mouth).  Pill pockets work just as well with my other pooch, but since I have gone the route of peanut butter with one, they all get the peanut butter with pills...and it's much cheaper!  I still buy the 3-packs of these capsules from Amazon.com when my supply is getting low, but only using 1 capsule daily per dog, it takes a few months to empty 3 bottles.  I still highly recommend this product and am very pleased with it.  I have even told my veterinarian about it and she is impressed as well.\",\n",

The idea has been around for centuries, but it's only been the last few decades that science understands why those who eat natural products like yogurt seem to be a bit healthier than others.Did you know that most of the immune system is in the gut?  Makes sense when you think about it.  When we eat, there are billions of bacteria, fungus, and viruses on our food.  (Viruses aren't a big problem, since they don't use food as a substrate; they look for living tissue to thrive in.) The stomach with its high acidity helps kill most bacteria and fungus, but some survive and get to the small and large intestine, where they can cause disease that is commonly called food poisoning.  Part of the problem is when there is missing 'good' bacteria that has been killed off or dies for some reason.  This niche may be filled by the bad bugs, leading to an unbalanced fauna in the gut.Pets have the same problem as we do.  And you know what a dog will eat; just about anything!  I find that regular use of a probiotic will help keep diarrhea under control, and makes the pet feel better.  Cats, too, can have digestive problems, and this type of product will probably help.The Gentle Digest seems to work well, and it reasonably easy to administer.  Recommended.\",\n",

I went with Gentle Digest because it had excellent reviews and was the cheapest probiotic I found, so I ordered it and tried it out. Let me tell you, this stuff reall works! After about 3 days of giving 2 capsules a day (like some other reviewers I just cracked them open over her food) her stools were back to their nice, firm selves lol and after only about a week her oral papillomas fell off! I have since been able to stop giving this, but plan on always keeping a bottle on hand, especially whenever either of my dogs is prescribed an antibiotic (which I think caused all of these issues in the first place--antibiotics at 6mos old wiped out the natural flora in her gut and affected her immune system).

       "  'reviewText': 'When I first purchased the LitterMaid, I was pleased. I never had a mechanical problem and my first couple of months with the product were uneventful. However, I soon found that it created much more work and hassel than a traditional litter box with plastic liners.One problem I faced was that if the storage bin became full, the clumps would pile up and the lid would not close. Sometimes, the clumps would even spill out of the side of the bin, creating a stinky mess. This problem was exacerbated by the fact that my cats had a tendency to use only one side of the litter box, so the bin would be full on that side in a short amount of time, causing extreme odor and spills. And, with 2 cats, it does not take long to fill that little storage bin, so if you have multiple cats, plan to empty it every couple of days.In addition, I found that the bottom of the box and the rake needed to be cleaned frequently so that they did not accumulate a build-up of crusty litter. If a build-up occurs on the bottom of the box, it will eventually become thick and hard enough that the rake will not be able to pass smoothly through the litter. After chiseling the dried litter off of the bottom of the box a few times (gross!) and dealing with the hassel of having to shake the contents of the storage bin in order to level it out, I finally decided that all of this hassel was not worth it and literally THREW THIS PRODUCT AWAY! I have never regretted the transition back to an old fashioned litter box, but I DO regret the money I spent on the LitterMaid!',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'after i bought a top-rated, well-reviewed gps receiver that couldn\\'t find a satellite with both hands inside a telephone booth, i thought i could never possibly waste money that badly again.was i wrong.(note: that is not a question.)from first use, the thing was either raking or it was off. i could not get it to stop. even if the cat was in the box and touching the \"sensor\" (yes, those are irony quotes), it just kept on plugging away. i turned it on manually when i went in to feed the cats until i had time to call customer service the following weekend. the rep sounded completely unsurprised that i was having this problem and gave me some simple steps to follow to get it to work: unplug it, lift the top part (the lighter beige you see in the photos, which is clipped to the box by two little green-grey tabs on the sides--you can see the little square on the side in the photo) off the bottom part, and run your finger along the track that the wheels follow until you find the reset button. click it on and off maybe 5-10 times, and it\\'ll work after that. she told me that i might have to do this 5-10 times for it to work (why 5-10 times? why both things 5-10 times? mysteries of life), but that it would work. (i explained all the other troubleshooting things i\\'d done, which are described clearly in the manual.)well, here we are 25 days after ordering, so probably three weeks into daily use. i still have to turn it on and off manually. now, that wouldn\\'t be a HUGE deal, since i\\'m in there anyway feeding the kittehs. however, because i can\\'t sense when it\\'s been 10 minutes since either cat went in, i have to hope that the clumps are fully formed. i think it has happened that way for me twice. the rest of the times, the mushy clod of unclumped kitty-pee mixed with the clay litter sticks to the rake as it goes through its little journey. also doesn\\'t sound like HUGE deal, does it? well...turns out that the rake doesn\\'t hit the aforementioned sensors until it goes alllll the way to the receptacle end and then allll the way to the resting end. and it can\\'t push through the litter if a big ol\\' piece of you-know-what is blocking the openings between the rake\\'s teeth. so every time it runs now, i have to sit beside it and use the little toothed plastic scoop to try to get all the gunk out from between the teeth. usually it still hasn\\'t pushed the litter into an even surface by then, so the litter forms little dunes at either end, and it can\\'t get up into the resting position. and i don\\'t want to leave it partially out of the resting position, because that\\'s down the side of the box into the...work area, and a kitteh will ...work on it. so i spend at least as much time as i\\'d spend scooping a regular box that size to get it cleared out all the way, getting the glued-to-the-bottom gunk out, and cleaning the rake until i can get it far enough up out of the box that nothing will get on it.and the return policy is that you have to return the item in its original condition and packaging. well, i got yer packaging right here, but i am prettty sure that this does not qualify as original condition. oh, did i mention that the gunk gets all up on the track and the sides of the rake? so those have to be cleaned off with a paper towel or something every few days.the good news is that the cats took to it right away--one of them with no urging at all (in fact, while i was still setting it up), and the other when the old box got dirty enough. the bad news is that i\\'m losing my patience with this contraption and putting it out with the trash any minute. the big boxes--which are easy to scoop, even if that\\'s no fun--are much easier for me. and for now they\\'re in closets or otherwise out of the way, rather than having to be plugged in in the main room.when our third bathroom is finished, i\\'m aiming for a cat genie, the box with the washable granules that flushes fluid waste away and scoops the poop into a receptacle. it\\'s three times the price of the littermaid, but i\\'m betting it won\\'t be worse than this.(i can\\'t remember ever writing a negative review before for a product, and certainly not one this negative. think how ..fill in your favorite adjective here.. i must have been to get back on amazon to look for this product again just to write this review. sad.)',\n",

All embarrassing odors were gone!  I am happy to use my little hand-vac to clean up the kicked-out litter every few days in exchange for an apartment that no longer smells like a litter box.Also, some reviewers have brought up the issue of cat litter:  buy the best-quality clumping litter you can.  The system uses so little of it compared to traditional boxes that it\\'s a wise investment towards a smooth-running system.All-in-all, it\\'s my opinion that the legitimate drawbacks (litter mess, noise, container cost, sticky clumps, etc.) are a small price to pay for a house that isn\\'t stinky!',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I\\'ve owned a LitterMaid for the last 6 or 7 years.  These units are generally reliable.  The biggest benefit is the odor control.  The dirty stuff is raked into a plastic catch-bin that has a lid.  The smell is kept to a minimum, until the catch-bin is too full and the lid doesn\\'t close fully.My first LitterMaid\\'s retractable power cord (on the rake) stopped recoiling into the unit, so it eventually got snagged on the rake, and it broke.  That was after more than 3 years of use.  Not bad for a product that runs at least 10-15 times a day (I\\'ve got 2 cats).  My second LitterMaid has been going strong since I replaced the last one well over 2 years ago.The most important thing I can suggest is using *premium* clumping litter.  I\\'ve been very happy with the ScoopAway brand.  Cheap litter breaks apart and makes a mess.  The next thing is to keep the litter level below the \"max fill\" line.  Too much litter causes the rake to bog down.  Also, cooking oil spray (pam) works very well to keep the clumps from sticking to the bottom.I use the \"disposable\" catch pans over and over until they crack.  I can normally get 2 or 3 months before I consider changing it out.  I can\\'t imagine tossing it out after one filling.  That\\'s a big expense, and a waste of money and a perfectly operable item.  I don\\'t use a liner/bag in the catch.  Just dump the dirty stuff into a bag and out to the trash.  I have two cats and they can fill the catch-bin in 2 to 3 days.  Normally, I just dump the bin, use a scoop to quickly get the smaller bits missed by the rake, and that\\'s it.  I have gone well over 6 months before doing any major cleaning of the box.If you have more than one cat, I would get the \"Mega\" model, since it is bigger.  The new Advanced model isn\\'t getting good reviews here at Amazon, so I would keep away from that unit.The LitterMaids are a bit noisy.  That maybe the biggest drawback.  Also, it is not a perfect cleaner, and will leave little bits that need to be scooped by hand every few days.  There are times when litter will build up in the back of the pan, and the rake will cycle over and over until you level things off (this can mostly be avoided by not filling to the top fill line).  It takes a few weeks to work out all the kinks, but once you do, you will love it.I will always own a LitterMaid because it keeps the house smelling like we don\\'t have cats.',\n",

My dog is a toy lover, but when he realized Mr. Bill also talked when he was bitten, he fell in love. Mr. Bill has been his favorite toy ever since, in spite of the fact that he stopped saying \"oh nooo\" after about 2 days. It felt like the sound box came apart but there\\'s no way to fix it without cutting the doll open. Regardless of the lack of sound, Roscoe carried Bill everywhere and put him through many doggy ER operations. Alas, doggy-medicine failed to save Bill\\'s internal organs. He lasted about 6 months but was definitely worth every penny. Even without any stuffing, I kept the doll because Roscoe kept crying at the trash can when I tried to throw him away. Your dog will love one.Update:  Mr. Bill #2 had a shorter lifespan than Bill #1, but it may have been due to holiday stress. He now joins Bill #1\\'s lifeless body on the shelf. Roscoe has mel been experimenting on Mr. Bill #3 for about 6 weeks, destroying moderately. Basically, I\\'ve come to find that each Bill doll\\'s lifespan is going to be dependent on the dog, so if you\\'re really interested in a long lasting toy, this may not be the one for you.To help put the toy\\'s size into perspective (and also to show just how attached my dog has become to Mr. Bill), I have uploaded a picture of Bill and doggy cuddling; it can be found in the Customer Images section on the right side of the product page alongside several other photos from very happy Bill owners.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'We are on, I believe, our fourth or fifth one of these.  You may assume by that they they are not indestructible, and you would be correct.  However, in every violent \"casualty,\" another dog has been the \\'killer.\\'  My dog LOVES these things and treats them like they are her baby.  She carries them to bed, she licks and licks them.  The licking was the \"cause of death\" for at least one of them; I have another around that\\'s still intact but looking rather haggard from being so well loved (so we have a new one as a \\'spare\\').  She LOVES the FIVE squeakers, and it\\'s a great soft, squishy size.  (FYI, my dog is a 7-year-old 70lb Golden Retriever female; she\\'s typically somewhat gentle on stuffies, although she\\'s certainly destroyed her fair share, too).  For MYYYY dog (and I know this doesn\\'t work with all dogs), if she sees me cuddle and pet her toy for a while first before letting her play with it, she tends to not destroy it (or, at least, not as quickly).  I\\'m not sure if it\\'s because it gets my scent on it or if she decides that my actions mean it\\'s to be \\'babied.\"  I guess I\\'m playing into her maternal instinct.  This has absolutely been her FAVORITE toy for the LONGEST of all, so I definitely recommend it if stuffies are at all an option for your dog.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'The actual toy lasted only a few weeks but for what it was you knew it wouldn\\'t last longer than a rope toy with a dog that likes to chew more than some dogs.Cons:-the arm stuffing came out first-the plush material got really gross with drool on the outside more than other dog toy materialPros:-Mr. Bill iconic soundmaker that says \"Oh Noooooo!\" still working great-batting inside can be reused to make a whole new toy.For those inclined to make their money go further and give Mr. Bill\\'s words new life I have instructions on how you can remake this dog toy into a new one:To reuse the soundmaker I left the soundmaker in Mr. Bill\\'s head because the batting (stuffing) there provided pretty good protection. I removed the batting from the rest of the body and placed Mr.s Bill\\'s head with the soundmaker inside into a long men\\'s sock (think sock monkey). I placed more batting around Mr. Bill\\'s head to give soundmaker more cushioning.  Suggestion: it may be a good idea to use packing tape on the outside of the soundmaker itself to keep it intact (just in case you have dog that likes to chew). One sock is not enough cushion surrounding Mr. Bill\\'s head though because holes can be made easily into just one sock layer and the jaw pressure from a dog\\'s mouth could break the plastic on the soundmaker. Because of this, I suggest 2-3 socks (short or long on the inside) with the outermost sock long because then you can tie 2-3 knots at the end.  What you have is a long body that you can draw some eyes on with permanent marker on one end of the body and the knots at the other end will be like a rope toy.Pros from this design:-dog can play with either end of the toy.-person can throw toy (without much drool) with the knotted end easily.-more stuffing= more protection for the soundmaker you wanted to reuse.-it\\'s easier to notice when the toy is being destroyed- then you just rewrap in another sock!Toy Diagram (Size approximate):[--10 inches long---] & 2-3 inches wide/~~~~~~~~~\\\\|~O~~~~~~~||~O~~~~~~~|--^-^-^--\\\\|~~~~~~~~~|--~-~-~--/\\\\~~~~~~~~~/',\n",

We have an 8-month old shepherd mix that is scared of the Mr Bill (which thrills the Lab as he can torment the puppy). I bought the puppy the Lambchop and he torments us all with the squeaker but he is happy. These toys have lasted longer with my dogs than any other toys I have bought. Things like a loofa toy don\\'t last 10 minutes and even the stuffingless toys are torns to shreds in short order.  I have had these two over a month now and only had to do minor repair. Though these toys do have stuffing so you have to watch your dogs, only portions of the toy rip easily for access to the stuffing (like the face). I have taught the puppy that if he tears his toy, \"mommy\" will just sew it up with dental floss and then he has to find a new place to tear. He learned quickly and no longer destroys every toy when it arrives! (If you do this, do yourself a favor and use the regular unflavored dental floss. I made the mistake of using a mint floss the first time I sewed up Lambchop and the puppy licked the poor lamby until it was one big spitball.) It turned out that both the puppy and the Lab are enamored with Lambchop and I was about to order two more but when I read the tag I discoverd these are made in China. I am usually very careful about food and toys that are made in China but had neglected to check this item. My vet says you need to be careful - particularly of the dye on toys made in China - and Mr Bill is heavily dyed. Though my dogs have had no ill effects from the toys they have to date I may give it more time before reordering.',\n",

We don't let her have it when she's home alone, since I don't want her to get bored and chew her way through to the squeaker, but otherwise, it's held up wonderfully. We also don't let her play 'pull' with it. It comes with a replacement squeaker, which is nice.It's the perfect size for our beagle, and almost the perfect toy. If the size we received is 'medium', I wouldn't order anything smaller for any dog except a Chihuahua.  I hope to find some more!\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Glad to see that so many others have found these to be great toys. These toys are among the best plush dog toys out there, and we\\'ve tried several. I don\\'t think any are truly \"indestructible\" since there\\'s always a dog somewhere that will defy that claim, but these are well made and worth buying for the majority of dogs.  Just be *sure* to buy the size that suits your dog; don\\'t buy one too small that can be swallowed easily!  Dr. Noys\\' toys are great in that they always include an extra squeaker in the pack, and the toy squeaker is easily replaceable in its hidden velcro pouch. (Squeakers are not indestructible; that\\'s why they include an extra. But the advantage here is that they are very secure, and can\\'t be eaten.) You can even buy separate packages of squeakers if your dog is tough on plush toys. Or you can remove the squeaker if it drives you crazy! ;-)Pay attention to the sizes listed: extra-small is really small, best for only the tiniest toy breeds or for small puppies. Medium will work for most dogs, but if your dog is a shredder, loves to destroy plush toys, only get the large sizes. If you have certain breeds, like Staffordshire terriers and bull dogs, then perhaps another toy would be a wiser choice. You know your dog.So if you\\'re tired of buying so-called \"dog toys\" that are really glorified baby toys and are easily destroyed, try these. Ours have lasted for two years with hard play, only replacing the squeakers.  Even better, they\\'re usually included in the Amazon 4-for-3 promotion, so you can get one free if you buy four!  That way you can test out different designs, or save one for later. Highly recommended!',\n",

A little bit of stuffing came out - not sure what part of the bears body - but other then that she is still playing with the bear. Let's see how long the body will last before she shredds it to pieces. I'm still looking for a toy that she cannot destroy and I haven't found it yet.

The problem is that they usually destroy them quickly, as they really enjoy playing with their stuffed toys together - with one pulling a leg & another pulling a arm, and they are also known to chew on them until they get to the insides - where they then work on spreading the filling all over our house.Because of this we decided not to get them anymore plush toys.

But one of the best things is that there\\'s only a tiny bit of stuffing in there - so even when they got the nose off, there was just one little blob of filling to pick up - and they can still play with it!Another plus is how easy it is to replace the squeaker.  We haven\\'t had to do it yet, but I checked it out - and it really is amazingly easy!  And it comes with an extra squaker too!Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend Dr. Noys Plush Teddy Bear to all pet owners - it\\'s well made, nearly indestructable and our dogs LOVE it!',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I\\'ve had the Dr. Noys teddy bear in the medium size for almost 6 months, purchased for my 30 lb sheltie girl.  Our dog is not a \"sit down and try to rip apart\" kind of dog, but she does love to play tug-o-war!  I usually grip the head while she grabs onto either the squeaking body or one of the limbs, and she hops and pulls and shakes and play-growls until she gets too thirsty to continue.  Hubby and I also play keep-away with the bear, tossing it back and forth so she\\'ll run between us for some exercise (she\\'s not much of a retriever).  Sometimes she\\'ll pick up the bear and bring it over to me to let me know it\\'s time to play, but otherwise she really doesn\\'t play with the bear on her own.  Not the fault of the bear, it\\'s just the way my sheltie is, and I hope it gives you a better idea of how this bear might hold up with your dog.This bear came with a free replacement squeaker, which I placed inside the fleece bag that contains the other squeaker, for extra squeaking fun.  Probably because of the extra protection the fleece gives, both squeakers have survived my little girl\\'s needle sharp teeth.  The fleece thing inside the bear also gives it bulk, without that messy stuffing that dogs so love to pull out.  I could hear and feel stitches pop on occasion while playing tug-o-war, but this toy really has held up well compared to other plush dog toys.  For 5 months, this bear looked perfect, other than the slobber on it.  Our bear has about three sizeable holes and is missing a bit of fur on its chest, which all happened in the last month, but we still use it because there\\'s no stuffing in the bear.  I\\'m currently looking for another Dr. Noys toy as a replacement, when that teddy bear goes to tug-o-war heaven.In addition to being very sturdy, this bear is super cute.  I have a photo of the Dr. Noys teddy bear in the arms of my sheltie who was laying down, and it\\'s a photo I\\'ll cherish forever.**UPDATE**  We\\'ve purchased our 2nd Dr. Noys teddy bear in medium size.  I tried buying regular stuffed animals, the kind intended for kids, at second hand stores but they all got pulled apart.  We now have 2 shelties and they\\'ve been plucking at this Kong teddy bear\\'s nose for a week (they really like that fleecy material) and this bear is holding up like a champ.',\n",

The body of the toy is only a couple inches long plus an additional couple inches for the unstuffed tail. It's great for small breeds, like shih tzus but I would hesitate to give this little thing to bigger dogs as I would be afraid they could shallow it. Just like with other Kong toys, the back is sealed with Velcro to replace the squeaker if need be and an extra squeaker is included. All in all it's a good toy and my dog does play with it (although it's definitely not on her short list of favorites) but be prepared that this is a tiny tiny toy.Just a note - the pictures show two different toys.

       "  'reviewText': 'These toys are among the best plush dog toys out there, and we\\'ve tried several. I don\\'t think any are truly \"indestructible\" since there\\'s always a dog somewhere that will defy that claim, but these are well made and worth buying for the majority of dogs.  Just be *sure* to buy the size that suits your dog; don\\'t buy one too small that can be swallowed easily!  Dr. Noys\\' toys are great in that they always include an extra squeaker in the pack, and the toy squeaker is easily replaceable in its hidden velcro pouch. (Squeakers are not indestructible; that\\'s why they include an extra. But the advantage here is that they are very secure, and can\\'t be eaten.) You can even buy separate packages of squeakers if your dog is tough on plush toys. Or you can remove the squeaker if it drives you crazy! ;-)  In the larger sizes you can replace the squeaker with a tennis ball for active dogs.Pay attention to the sizes listed: extra-small is really small, best for only the tiniest toy breeds or for small puppies. Medium will work for most dogs, but if your dog is a shredder, loves to destroy plush toys, only get the large sizes. If you have certain breeds, like Staffordshire terriers and bull dogs, then perhaps another toy would be a wiser choice. You know your dog.So if you\\'re tired of buying so-called \"dog toys\" that are really glorified baby toys and easily destroyed, try these. Ours have lasted for two years with hard play, only replacing the squeakers. Even better, they\\'re usually included in the Amazon 4-for-3 promotion, so you can get one free if you buy four (smaller sizes)!  That way you can test out different designs, or save one for later. Highly recommended!',\n",

It is about the size of a mouse, only it's empty except for the squeaker.  I put both squeakers in to make it fill out and squeak more easily.... it's tiny!  It is good for a small dog puppy, not a larger breed puppy, unless it wants to play with something the size of a mouse.  My dog gets very excited about toys but this was quickly abandonned after a little over 5 minutes.  She's 13 lbs.  I'm not crazy about the velcro and how  you can take the squeakers out, that's something I believe some dogs can easily figure out.\",\n",

So far, it seems to be a sturdy toy, but it has yet to be tested by a good game of tug-of-war between Harri and her sister, Sally.

There\\'s not a dog toy made that can withstand the chewing of a particularly determined mutt. So the only really fair tests for a dog toy are whether your dog likes it; whether it\\'s safe; and whether it holds up reasonably well when subjected to day-to-day gnawing? With those tests in mind, the \"Dynamic Duo,\" (a male Westie and female Scotty) give Frosty Dog four stars. They are currently trying to dismember their second. The first one lasted a year, the last six months of which were spent with two legs and no nose. And they would still be playing with it, except that I got tired of looking at the poor bedraggled thing. By the way, I think that the \"large\" FD is probably the right size for all, but the very smallest, dogs. The Dynamic Duo only weigh in at 20 pounds each, but the \"large\" FD suits them fine.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I\\'d previously had a Dr. Noys medium-size teddy bear to play tug-o-war with my 30 lb knee-high sheltie, and after 6 months of tug-o-war, it looked like it had open-heart surgery.  Held up quite well (looked perfect for the first 5 months), so I decided to get another Dr. Noys toy for my little girl, as she loves stuffed toys.I don\\'t use this medium-size Frosty Dog for tug-o-war, as it\\'s a bit too small, she ends up accidentally biting my fingers when she tries to get a better grip on the toy (didn\\'t have that problem with the medium size teddy bear).So instead, my husband and I play keep-away with the Frosty Dog, tossing it back and forth so she\\'ll run between us for some exercise (she\\'s not much of a retriever).  When we throw it short so she has a chance to get the toy, she pounces on it and prances around with it in her mouth like it\\'s the best thing ever.  She\\'ll also run to her toy box and select this toy when my husband is laying on the floor doing back exercises, and she\\'ll plop the Frosty Dog on his chest as a not-so-subtle way of saying \"Since you\\'re down here at my level, play with me!\".  Sometimes when our sheltie is super happy, she\\'ll pick the Frosty Dog up and hold it in her mouth for a minute, squeaking the toy every couple seconds, just for the joy of it.  The squeaker has held up great over 2 months of her joyful squeaking.  She simply loves this toy.My dog is not a determined toy destroyer, thankfully.  But, based on my experience with my other Dr. Noys teddy bear toy, their toys are built to be far superior to other plush toys.**UPDATE**  September 13th, 2008:  Last week, I had to take this toy away because Zoey had managed to pluck open the side of the Frosty Dog\\'s face, exposing the irresistible stuffing inside.  Curses!  If I had sewing skills, I\\'d take upholstery thread (tough stuff!) and sew it back up.  But, I don\\'t have sewing skills.  Double curses!  I\\'m searching for a new toy.  *sigh*  Still, the Frosty Dog lasted over 4 months, that\\'s not too bad.',\n",

I just wondered how long this would last because I knew it would be hours or days of enjoyment before the kill. She had a blast squeaking this thing and shaking it like nuts for about a day before she fixated on getting the squeak out. She couldn't open the velcro so so she made her own hole to get the squaker out, as it is thin material, to destroy the squeak gnawing off the whistle. She went though both squeakers in 2 days but still loves to haul the carcass around for me to throw for her. She must still love it because she's got a boatload of other toys and she still gets this to throw and catch. Yes, both the beaver and duck are empty carcasses but she still carries em around.

Although frontline does kill ticks you might get more for your money but then again my cat does not have a tick problem. The applications were really easy to apply. Instructions are really clear and self explanatory. My poor cat was meowing in distress for days and I would comb him and use flea sprays but the fleas just kept coming. So I use advantage on him and I was just amazed on how quick and well it works. I combed his fur and not one flea was found except for some dead ones.

Amazon shipping is usually spot-on, but this was not one of those times. Frustrating to wait for something that we needed for our pets. So I suggest ordering ahead of your actual need.We have 2 indoor cats that had what I would call a minor flea problem. The initial dose seemed to do the job. And unlike some treatments I've used it was well tolerated. No irritation to the skin, etc.We had a recurrence of fleas just over a month later and had to re-apply the product. I know fleas are hard to get rid of completely so I'm not totally surprised. I was hoping that the first dose would end the problem, seeing as the fleas weren't that bad.I shopped around and Amazon had the best price. So really the only thing bugging me was the mishandling of the shipping.\",\n",

Now if you have indoor cats, you most likely will not need to treat your cat all the time. Use a FLEA COMB a few times a week to monitor the presence of fleas. If you see one single flea, get them all treated, but use HALF DOSE. That may all your indoor cat needs.Once in a blue moon my indoor cats need to be treated, and this works well.Also please vacuum your house.

Within a week of the first dose of Advantage my whole home settled right down and the cats and I were no longer getting any bites. My cats are 16, 18, and 24 pounds. (Yes, the vet and I have gone rounds and rounds with the big boy.) The 9 pounds and up vial is fine for them. Just one vial, and an upset cat for a few moments for putting stuff on their shoulders, and the fleas are gone.At first I thought there were no more fleas in the neighborhood, but the neighbors pets were still covered in fleas. Apparently when you have a pet, the fleas prefer the animal and will go to it (treated or not) for a feast. When the flea medicine works, all the fleas in the home are wiped out too. Vet said I didn't need to waste my money on flea bombs for the house since we have cats. Living in a humid environment (Oregon where we don't tan, we rust) Advantage actually seems to work better and fleas are less likely to develop a tollerance.I have a reminder that tells me to get more medicine every month, and won't be without this. Best product for my area.I had heard that some people were buying this in pet stores and inside the packaging and blister seal was another product (Advantix for large dog), but buying through Amazon so far I have never had that happen. I still check each tube before administering the medicine though. I don't know if I have just been lucky, because our Dentist's receptionist said she just went through this when she bought the product at the pet store. I still strongly recommend this product though. Just check everything to be sure.\",\n",

My friend's Yorkie had a seizure within 40 minutes of this product being put on him.  All of these topicals are poison.  Search online for natural flea and pest control; you'll find lots of options.  One thing we use is neem soap on our dogs; it not only kills pests but it also repels them.  You can also make a natural spray using 1 cup distilled water, several drops of an essential oil like cedar wood, citronella, lavendar, peppermint.  You need to also add a tsp of castile soap so the essential oils will mix with the water.  Spray on your hands and rub all over your dog's coat before it goes outdoors in areas where there could be pests.  Re-apply every 2 hrs.  This is safe for pets and works; nothing harmful.  Don't get the spray mixture in their eyes, nose and mouth.  Vets say these are safe but that's not true.  The companies also only test these products for 30-90 days because they know that longer useage will show damage to the animal's liver.  Anything put on the skin is absorbed into the blood stream and then passes through the liver.  NO to this junk; it's as bad as spraying your pet with Raid.\",\n",

Since the dog version of the medication is the same active ingredient as the cat, we buy the large dog and meter it out based on their weight. One of our cats is sensitive to the \"recommended\" dose strength. We have found that if we dose based on how many mL should be administered per pound, we save even more...and of most imporatance, we are not giving a larger dose of chemicals than is needed to achieve the same results!Relief for the pets was immediate. The same day that we applied the chemical, they stopped scratching as bad. Since the house is all hardwood, no rugs, no carpet, very little cloth of any kind anywhere due to allergies...with continued cleaning of the house on a daily basis, the population of fleas soon dwindled to almost nothing. Four stars because it is a chemical. I really wish there was an organic alternative that is effective! We use food grade diatomaceous earth in the house, but only as a dusting before we vaccuum.

They all had fleas after I forgot to treat my dog before I went on a lengthy vacation and one of my cats ended up living outside for two weeks (escaped while I was on vacation).  Anyway, I was so worried and upset when I discovered that my pets had fleas.  I gave them all flea baths, picked off live fleas, gave them other flea treatments that didn't seem to work (the store-bought flea drops, for example), washed linens, and I still could not get rid of them or even see a dent in the population.  That's when I decided to start hunting online for a solution since taking them all to the vet would be very expensive.I bought the large dog Advantage (>55 lbs) with the intent to divide it amongst my pets.  I used all but 0.5 ml of one vial for the first treatment.  I have not treated them a second time yet, but they are due very soon.  After treatment, the place on their back was not greasy.  In fact, by the second day, I couldn't even tell they had something put on their backs, and it didn't smell bad.  It did not smell AT ALL.  On day one, I found quite a few fleas laying around on the bed blanket. They had evidently jumped off the pets.  They seemed very confused and slow, but were still alive.  I made sure I killed them in case they were only temporarily impaired.  By the next day, I could find no evidence of fleas on my pets....not even any flea debris (I guess the pets had groomed themselves to remove it). All the pets were extremely thankful for treatment and extra loving after they no longer had fleas pestering them.I've continued to snuggle with my pets, checking them daily for fleas or signs of them, and monitor the bedding for any evidence of fleas.  NOTHING to be seen or found!  I am so happy with the Advantage flea treatment!  I will treat them all again in a few days in order to make sure any new eggs hatching don't re-infest the pets.I put 1 ml each on a 13 lb rat terrier, 20 lb cat, and 16 lb cat.  On my smaller 6 lb cat, I administered 0.5 ml.  I certainly wanted to make sure I gave them enough since I think I had a serious flea problem and knew some of the medicine would be rubbed off onto their surroundings.  They suffered no ill effects, only benefits, from the Advantage.  I benefited greatly by only spending $31.50 on Advantage that would treat all of my pets (4) for 4 months (plus 2 large pets for another month OR the dog for two more months, who is really the one who needs protection since he goes potty outside).  I really recommend this product.  My pets and I thank you!In addition, I ordered this product late on a Monday night and had it in my position by Thursday evening.  Not bad for using the free shipping option.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'As a former Veterinary Technician I have considerable experience and knowledge about fleas and their life cycle. However, you don\\'t have to be a technician to do a google or wikipedia search to learn a little bit before writing an ignorant review. The vast majority of the bad reviews I have read here, are obviously (to me) from people who really do not understand where fleas come from and what you have to do to eliminate them.Here\\'s the thing: 90% of the flea population that feeds off of your pet are NOT ON THE ANIMAL RIGHT NOW. That\\'s right, the vast majority of the pests are actually on your floors, carpets, furniture, pet beds and so forth - waiting to hop on Spike and Fluffy when they are hungry. Fleas feed, then jump off the animal, while some more of their family jump on and start feeding in their place. To truly manage the flea problem requires TREATING THE ANIMAL AND THE PREMISES. If you do not treat the premises (including the yard) you will never get ahead of the problem. Sevin dust in the yard or some pyrethrin-based spray have been effective for me for many many years.Also, the lack of effectiveness that people think they are seeing is not because the product is not as good, it is because the fleas have become tougher over the years. You just have to attack the problem on all fronts and be as persistent as the pests themselves. Treat the animals and the premises and don\\'t let up.Now, I am going to save some people a lot of money. The drug in Advantage for Dogs and Advantage for Cats is exactly the same drug (Imidacloprid) at the same concentration.If you buy this \"Large Dog\" package, you get four 4ml tubes. If you then empty those into a vial or vials, you can use a syringe (without needle) to apply the right dosage to your dogs AND cats. In fact, if your cats are under 10 pounds, you can get 10 cat doses out of each of these vials. That\\'s a real bargain!Advantage II is the same, but adds Pyriproxyfen for the full life cycle coverage.Use the following chart and you will be fine.Cats up to 9 pounds - 0.4mlCats 10+ pounds - 0.8mlDogs 11-20 pounds - 1.0mlDogs 21-55 pounds - 2.5mlDogs 55+ pounds - 4.0ml',\n",

And, since he's primarily an inside dog, we were also experiencing flea bites.  Not a good thing!I found, that with moderate environmental control, an application of Advantage, and administration of a Capstar tablet (which I highly recommend), that we were able to bring the critters under control.I know, I hate chemicals for my pet, too.  But, fleas are not benign---they can cause severe flea allergies---and those disgusting tapeworms.  Plus, your dog can't be the happy canine companion he wants to be, if he is constantly digging, can't rest, etc.  Who knows the long term effects, but right now, I know we are all at peace here, so it is a risk worth taking to improve the quality of his life---now.I'm delighted that you can now buy Advantage online.

It's kind of a pain mashing the tablet and mixing it up into wet catfood.  Also, it takes a couple of days to take effect.  But - it does work well, and my cat is very happy.

I had been using Capstar (which works miraculously but is too expensive to use daily as a stand alone) and read many reviews and articles stating how great Capstar and Program are when used together.My dog has allergies (nasal and sometimes skin).  Her hair started thinning out a little in the back and I just figured it had to do with her skin allergies.  It very slowly kept getting worse.  I have been trying over and over to figure out if there was something that could have been causing this, I realized it started after giving the Program tablets.  I skpped the past month's tablet and hopefully her hair will grow back in.  Can't decide on a monthly to use on her, because Frontline Plus gives her hives on her belly.  I will continue to use Capstar as needed (a couple times a week or whenever she plays with the neighbor's dog or grass is long/wet and itching starts).I'm not saying it is a problem for all dogs, but it did cause the hair loss on my dog.  This may not be a common side effect, but I can't recommend it to others because of this.\",\n",

However, there are times when I am looking to clean just a small area and don't want to have to pull out the Spotbot, fill it, etc.I have found that the Pre-Treat works great by itself to remove some spots.  It works great as intended (pre-treating), but I've used it to remove small pet food stains on rugs and it works great.  It smells pleasant as well.For pre-treating, I've used it and its removed stains like pet vomit or urine in cases where the Spotbot worked but left an area slightly darker than the rest of the carpet.  A quick spray with the Pre-Treat and everything was as good as new.  I typically have not left it on for the recommended time (12-72 hours), finding a half hour to be plenty.  However, I did have a small, tough stain that other cleaners did not remove, so I tried this and left it covered for about a day.  After a little rubbing afterward with a cloth and water, it did come out.I have used this on an off-white textured sofa and ottoman as well, and its worked effectively.\",\n",

Happily, I got to try out this pre-treatment, and am really glad I did.  Although it's intended to be used in conjunction with the regular formula, I decided to try it alone on a couple of mild stains (fresh ones).  Then I loaded the machine with plain water and walked away.  When I came back, the stains were completely gone - and at a fraction of the cost of using the in-machine formula.  I also like that using plain water to clean up the pre-treatment means I don't have to worry about any cleaning residue on the carpet.A third stain a few days later did require a double treatment, but it was still easier and cheaper than the old way.  I'll keep a bottle of the regular formula on-hand for really stubborn spots, but from now on will just use this and plain water.  Highly recommended!\",\n",

Then I let it sit a good 20nminutes while I got the carpet shampooer ready.At first a couldn't see much change but after going over the area twice with my Bissel shampooer filled wit Bissle carpet shampoo and water, the stains just started to disappear.Once I was done, I was prepared to do that spot again the next day when it had dried completely.Such a surprise to look at it the next day and see that it was just as clean as the rest of the room and NO MORE STAINS! Awesome because this a low profile carpet that is mostly white.I think it was the enzyme power that Bissel mentions that is supposed to break down pet stains SO pet stains are organic and so are food stains.I will be keeping this product on hand to catch the small spots, in future, before they become one huge spot!\",\n",

The problem is that since it\\'s a pre-treat, if you use it withBISSELL 2X Pet Stain & Odorcarpet formula or with one of their machines, it\\'s hard to tell which one deserves the credit.I used this on a variety of \"pet problems\" ranging from fresh pet urine to vomit. It got the odor out instantly and the carpets ended up stain free. I used aBISSELL Lift-Off Deep Cleaner, 94Y2as a portable spot cleaner, and was able to let the pre-treat do most of the work by merely giving a slight spray with the machine and a light brushing as it vacuumed up the spot. There\\'s no question that the two worked well in combination, and with the rotating brushes of the full machine you could expect it to do an outstanding job.I did have some older hidden stains that it did not remove, but those are ones that had already been treated with other Bissell pet and non-pet products in the past, as well as with non-Bissell products. So if you have some stains so tough that absolutely nothing seems to get them out, this one might not work miracles. And Bissell\\'s non-pet oriented products are pretty good to begin with, so using them alone might be all you need. But with this one and their other pet related ones in particular, they go after pet specific odors instantly and eliminate them, not just hide them.',\n",

I dismissed it as simply a gimmick for people who didn't want to bend over to pick up a ball, and/or had no idea how to throw a ball. Nearly a decade later, I finally decided to give one a try.I have no problem throwing a ball a fair distance with my arm, but the Chuckit allows me to throw it even further, with significantly less effort.Though regular tennis balls work fine, I'd recommend using the Fetch balls that Chuckit sells. Compared to tennis balls, they're easier to clean, I don't have to worry about my dog chewing them (since there is no fuzz for her to rip off), and they bounce a lot better (even on grass).I also have the Erratic ball, but don't recommend it as much. It certainly lives up to its name when it bounces around, but its awkward shape makes it more difficult to fit snugly into the Chuckit, which makes it more difficult to throw, meaning it doesn't travel nearly as far.\",\n",

They are durable, inexpensive, and a great aid to throwing balls, especially for we women who don't have the upper arm strength of you men.  They also allow me to pick up the ball (any standard tennis ball will fit, though it comes with a two toned ball) and throw it again without bending over, and you need not touch a slobbery, muddy, grass covered wet ball. I can throw a ball at least 3-4 times farther with the Chuckit! than without one.  They are very common among local dog owners, and the dogs love them.  Treat yourself and your four legged loyal friend to this great toy.  I only wish I had invented it!\",\n",

This is the only thing I've found that would truly tire her out (without knocking myself out in the process).  And even now at 7, she's like a puppy again every time she sees the Chuck-it come out.  I had surgery on both hands this year and had a hard time throwing balls at all, never mind far enough for them to get any exercise.

I can spend hours at the part with this toy playing with me dog. It's very sturdy and easily grabs the ball from the ground. It did take some time to be able to adjust how I threw the ball with it so that it didn't just fly into the ground (I put too much arm swing into it). This toy helps you throw the ball farther than with just your arm and keeps your hands clean. The Chuck It does come in a few different sizes also, depending on the size of your dog. It also comes in a variety of colors. Something else that I like about this dog toy is that the balls come in BRIGHT colors so I never loose them!If you have a dog that likes to play fetch with tennis balls, or a dog full of energy this is the toy for you!\",\n",

You see, my husband is an avid hunter and although we did not buy the dog only for hunting - we wanted a family dog that can go like we do - we had hoped that one way we could get him exercised would be through retrieving. We attempted to begin the awakening of genetics early (the day we brought him home). However, we have children, and although we warned them many times and watched the dog training videos together, as a family, on a loop for days - they thought playing chase and tag with him was a load of fun (which, lets be honest, it is)! Needless to say, he would chase the ball, BUT good luck getting him to bring it back! After the children realized what they had actually done - they vowed no more chase with balls...and we have attempted to begin the training over again. A couple of months ago I started working with him with a Kong ball - the red one. He would retrieve for a little bit - 5 or so throws and then start messing around. I read and watched more videos and worked/played more with him...but he would lose interest, and I had a SLIMEY hand - gross. So, when I saw the Chuck-it and it was on sale - I bought it. I thought at least my hand would not be so icky. It was L-o-V-e at first throw for this guy! He is absolutely obsessed! We bought the rubber balls as he is an avid chewer and would destroy a tennis ball in 2 seconds flat - and the rest is history. I don't think the only reason he is retrieving now is due only to the Chuck-It being so awesome, although it is pretty great. We really worked with him. But it came to our house at just the right time and now I have a clean hand and a VERY happy retriever, who also happens to be a Labrador :D\",\n",

However, we use the kong squeaky balls instead of the harder chuckit balls.  Often they get dirty or currently icy and are larger than an average tennis ball.  It is nearly impossible to get the chuckit to grab and then release the ball to throw it.  Often it just sticks in the holder and he barks and barks when I futilely try to fling the ball again and again.  I've even broken the grabber end trying to 'stretch it out' so the ball will release.Hard to describe, but this version of the chuckit is just great.  The whole white stick is more flexible and springy and the ball grabber end is also more flexible so the ball doesn't get stuck.GREAT improvement and definitely better than the original design.

Don\\'t get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I\\'m not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch, this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther, and they won\\'t wear out as quickly. Plus if they are \"old\" they don\\'t even have to bend over to pickup the ball!

I agree w/the other reviews that the shorter handle in the small ball launcher is harder to throw and harder to control and not in the \"fun\" category.

The manufacturer is Canine Hardware and I suggest we send them lots of emails requesting they return the small ball launcher w/the 18\" handle.

       "  'reviewText': \"This is the &#34;Pro&#34; version and it sends the ball 50% farther than the standard 26M.  Measured the average throw today; it was 273 feet.  The dog caught the ball on the roll, otherwise it would've rolled farther.  Admittedly, this was with the wind, but 273 feet is incredible.  Using a standard pressure-less ball, presumably the Chuck-it ball would go farther.  This extra throw-distance appears to be mostly from the thinner and smoother arm.  Less wind resistance.The thinner arm does feel a little more flexible, but it's still very controllable.  It's easy to place the throw exactly where one wants.The Pro version is about an inch shorter than the 26M, which may not matter to most folks, but it means an extra inch bending over.  An inch won't matter to most, but if one has a bad back and a dog that insists on fifty or more tosses per session, it adds up.  Nevertheless, the dog gets a better workout and the Pro version is worth the extra few bucks.The handle is much more comfortable too.  Rubberized and form-fitting.  The original Chuck-it was the best man-dog interactive toy ever; this new Pro version is a refinement over the original and well worth it..\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I have a 30 lb dog that is stupidly fast and loves to fetch.  She can fetch for hours...even when I am throwing it as far as I can (which is a good distance).  So this chuck it launcher is awesome because now we can go and have fun and she can really get going.  Plus i don't have to pick up that nasty ball....I do suggest getting the chuck it ultra balls because they are rubber and bounce more, so your dog can see it when its farther away.  Also, it doesn't pick up as much dirt, so it stays cleaner too.  This was a problem I saw with my dog because the regular tennis balls collected so much dirt that she would accidentally swallow some as she was fetching and then end up dry heaving later that night.....I also suggest getting the pro version of chuck it because the handle is soooo much better that its worth the extra money.Caution though...if you throw it to far and your dog isnt paying attention or isnt quick enough to find it before it stops bouncing...you will be walking a long way to find the ball for them...especially if you paid extra money for the nicer chuckit ultra balls.  Luckily my dog is OCD and has to have the first ball we throw, so if she misses it she searches for it for at least 10  min before giving up.Oh and the Chuckit works ok with regular tennis balls, but it is sized just a bit smaller than a tennis ball size. So, it doesnt quite release the ball as quickly.  I only use the ultra balls though...so no complaints by me.\",\n",

There's nothing she loves more than her tennis balls except maybe chasing them - practice for catching the squirrels on our property!  This Chuckit is easy to use and once you get the hang of it you can pitch a ball a long distance saving on elbows and shoulders.  Any tennis ball will work in the head of the device.  The best way to lob a ball a goodly distance is to NOT insert the ball all the way into the head.  Place the ball about half way in, just enough so it doesn't fall out, take a standing or sitting position, and swing your arm up from a ground pointing position to just head level and let fly!  Pretend you are a kid again and swing your arm like a windmill.  Just stop the motion when your arm is pointing straight towards the heavens.  The ball will launch at least 50-80 feet in an arch.  Great invention and I love it and my dog loves it.  In all fairness to anyone who isn't finding it easy to use, well, neither has my husband been overly successful at using it either but then he's not very coordinated, LOL!  Such a simple device and I only wish I had thought of it.  Buy it and your dog will love you forever and you won't suffer any more shoulder pain pitching those balls for that slobbering ball of fur you own.  Enjoy!\",\n",

He does like to fetch his squeaky balls and his crunchy balls, but something about the Chuckit balls (I had 4 different kinds) left him bored. When I did use it, I could not get the balls to fly far like I've seen others.  I'm guessing it was me, not the Launcher.  My dog did, ultimately, like the Chuckit Launcher.  One day, when I wasn't looking, he chewed it up.  It is now one of his favorite chew toys.  Given how long it is lasting, it wasn't such a bad deal.\",\n",

The felt disintegrates and then the rubber ball splits into two pieces.  I thought this was just how life was going to be: forever buying these balls for our launcher.  Then a friend told me that they just use regular tennis balls so I tried it.  I bought a pack of 10 cheap-o tennis balls for the same price as I was paying for 2 Chuck it balls and three weeks later we're still using on our first ball- amazing!  It fits perfectly in the launcher and still has felt and bounce.  Thank you, Chuckit! for making the medium sized launcher a standard tennis ball size.

Seriously, I'm kind of amazed he hasn't figured out how to open the fridge yet. But he's still young, so who knows.Because of his food issues, Mr. CrankyCat is extremely sensitive about his meal times. Meaning, he starts howling for dinner or breakfast about an hour before he knows it's coming - just to make sure I don't forget. Yeah, he's a thoughtful guy, although that's not usually how I feel about it at 5:30 am when he starts up.At first, I thought this thing was a piece of garbage - my cat quickly figured out how to twirl the top and boom, it was buffet time. Then I did something revolutionary - I read the directions. I know, crazy, right?Turns out you have to snap the center part into place in TWO spots, not just one. If you miss one of them, any kitty with half his wits about him will figure out how to break into it. If you lodge the center part properly, it's extremely secure. Secure enough that my guy has given up on trying to break into it, which is nothing short of a miracle.Yes, it's a little annoying that you have to turn it on at precisely the time you want it to start it's timer, but really - you'd be feeding your cat at that time anyway, right? So you have to fill a few more compartments at the same time, big whoop. It won't kill you.It took my cat a while to understand that I did not actually need to be present for the food to magically appear in the feeder. Now, he leaps like a reindeer on Christmas when he hears the motor whirring and is off like a shot. He even lets me sleep in a little later now, although he sits on my bedside table and watches me sleep until I get up. Creeper.\",\n",

It's fairly true-to-time, though I think it's running in something like 6.75 hour increments rather than 6. The best part, though, is that my cat somehow immediately figured out that this emotionless machine is now in control of his food, and that meowing at me would do nothing to change his feeding schedule. I'm seriously cold when it comes to not rewarding that behavior - I'll let him go to bed hungry before I'll cave in and feed him to shut him up - but somehow he knew that yelling at me and getting fed must in some way be related. Now he thinks it's in the hands of this little flattened and earless R2D2, so we're fine.Another major benefit is that he doesn't think that R2D2 is going to yank the food away from him, like he always suspected I might, so he's not wolfing his meals down and hoarking them back up.It's a good product if you have a food-neurotic cat. It's also going to be nice for when I have to go away on weekends.I already had a Tenergy battery charger that accommodates almost all sizes, including 9V, so I just bought two rechargeable 9V batteries.

We chose this model because it was reasonably priced and holds enough food for up to six days. The unit has six pie-shaped (wedge) sections that you fill with food; one section is always exposed, so it basically holds food for today plus five more servings. There is a switch that lets you select between 6, 12, or 24-hour serving intervals. At the preset interval, the lid advances to the next section. Each section holds enough dry food forup to two cats if you fill them up. There is no clock display on the unit; there is a manual \"advance\" button on the unit; whenever you press this, the lid rotates to the next opening and it resets the timer so that it will advance at the preset interval after this, or it will advance at the preset interval after you install the battery (one 9-volt Alkaline battery). There are some small water tanks on the botton that are intended to be filled with water and frozen to keep canned food cold, but they are useless after more than a few hours.

The main problem is that you can't program it, you can only set it to go off EXACTLY 6/12/24 hours from the time you turn it on. So if you want to feed your cat at 6am, you better be around at 6pm or midnight to enable it. If you don't use this every day and always have it turned on, this becomes a major hassle.The ice packs sort of work, but didn't keep the food particularly cold, freezing the food worked much better. They are very thin plastic that you fill with water, and I have a feeling the continual expanding of the ice will eventually break them.After a month I was so sick of trying to get this going at the correct times that I ditched it for the &#34;PetSafe 5-Meal Electronic Pet Feeder&#34;.

       "  'reviewText': \"I have had these feeders for 2 years now, and I still trust them. They are excellent for weight loss in those cats that cry for food all the time (eventually kitty learns that you don't give food, the feeders do!). They are fairly loud (which actually turns out to be good because they call the cats to eat). I have 2 and they stay in sync just enough to let them eat at the same time (and so 1 cat doesn't get all the food and the other gets none.)They hold about 1/4 cup of dry kibble well. Anymore would be too much (so maybe not a good option for dogs over 15 lbs or so). It has setting to rotate every 6, 12 or 24 hours. A little green light blinks every few seconds to let you know that the battery is still good (they take 9 volt batteries, and I haven't had to change them very often).Only 4 star review because I would rather have an 8 hour setting instead of a 6 hour setting. Also, don't use it for canned food, even with the freeze tray-it just gets gross.\",\n",

It makes a sound like it's going to open but then stops and does not reveal the food driving my cat crazy. It usually only takes a nudge from me to get it to open after that but my cat is not as smart as the cats in other reviews. He comes running for me to come and nudge it even after showing him with his own paw how he can do it himself!!! It is probably worth replacing it after two years or so to ensure it works properly all the time especially when you won't be there within a few hours of feeding time. I'm going to try the LeBistro though next since it holds so much more food, it will require even less energy to keep your cat happy and has the added benefit that you can see when it's empty. With the Lentek you have to mark it in some way which compartment is empty so you don't forget to fill it. Since my cat doesn't budge the dish at all I just keep the first empty compartment against the wall so I always know when it will need to filled up! Good luck-it's good but for the money, even having to replace it every two years or so it is still worth it!\",\n",

It\\'s a smart design, but they\\'ve got many flaws.They use a LOT of batteries - the 9 volts die after 2-3 weeks (so you have to keep a *close* eye on it), and they turn very slowly because of the weak, poorly designed motor. They both died within about 6 months, and I had to replace them.Also, it\\'s not really a 6-day unit - it\\'s a 6 *meal* unit. Each tray only holds up to 1/2 cup. Since my cats (normal size) eat 1/3 cup per meal, I must set the unit to go off twice a day. I can\\'t imagine this working for a large dog. And, since the sixth compartment is perpetually open, you can only set it for 2 1/2 days in advance. Not much help for vacations.The person who said their unit has been working for 8 years is either mistaken or lying. This Asian company is barely 3 years old.

This feeder is just for her and works perfectly for her. She has not even tried to bust it open, even though she sniffs it a little after I put the food in, she is satisfied that she cannot reach the food and wanders away. L is a very simple cat.My other cat V is thin and just a nibbler, and is very curious and athletic, her seperate, open food dish is up high, so L can\\'t reach it, and so V can nibble all day. If I put V\\'s food in this timed feeder, I have no doubt she would outsmart it and/or break it open in a day.Notes:*I found it easy to set.*Quiet, even in my small apt.(but I live in the city, which is noisy itself).*I found it straightforward to pop apart and add food, just pay attention to the compartments so they are lined up properly for re-assembly(ex: make sure you place food in the compartment that it will open to next).*It is a simple machine. The time settings are not very adjustable - 6, 12 hr, etc.*I use it for an extra feeding when I work long days(12+ hrs) - but I am not sure I\\'d rely on it alone for a long weekend, but seems fine for an overnight. I prefer a live person to check in on my cats and apt anyway when I\\'m away.*I use it for dry food only. I would definitely not use it for wet food.* Must stare at it until you see the green light flash, to check to see if it\\'s actually \"on\".* A little big, very round, so I put it under the chair or table in kitchen so L has easy access to opening slot.Overall, I found it worth my time & money.

Well, about 8 months of using it, it started developing problems; it would turn halfway, then backtrack, then turn to the intended slot. Now, 10 months in, it completely ping-pongs back and forth--and it won't stop; I have to turn it off midway and then turn it back on so it will turn to the correct food slot. I figured no problem, I'm still under the 1-year warranty--wrong! I checked the manual and they only offer a 90-day warranty. What?! Had they offered a 1-year warranty AND I was out of that 1-year warranty, I would've bought another one as a replacement. But the 90-day warranty is pretty worthless and shows they have no confidence behind their products. I've already purchased the QPet Timed Automatic Pet Feeder (hopefully I won't have the same issues).Other dislikes: horrible warranty, noisy motor, unable to set actual time (only 6-, 12- or 24-hour time intervals from initially powering it on), uses expensive D battery (thought the battery has lasted quite some time).\",\n",

He is my problem cat as he does not get along well with my other cats and prefers to be alone and loves to hunt.  As a result of his wanderings he does not eat properly and this is the third time in his eleven years that he has gotten worms.  Tape Worm Tabs were recommended to me by my vet and I have been using them ever since.  They work really well and it is not too hard to give to the cat.  Two tabs work well with one dose given and then a couple of weeks later a second dose and you are done.The only thing that I don't understand is why only 3 tablets in the bottle.  Not a big deal but it would seem more logical to put either 2 tabs or 4 tabs in a bottle.  Other than that, the tabs do the job and do it well.\",\n",

So, when I told my mother about it, she said I should have smashed /killed it because it was a worm. After that I started researching online with various websites and found out a lot of information about Goldie's situation which was mild considering other reviews about types of worms. Realizing she had tape-worms, began comparing prices and products and eventually settled on this product with consultation from a Vet's assistant via phone. Read the instructions and applied them as soon as possible. I smashed the tablet into her food with some fish oil and she ate it all. Afterwards, she went to sleep and I didn't hear or see her till the following day Tuesday the 7th with no outward visible signs of fleas or worms.

       "  'reviewText': \"Well, we were searching for a dog ramp our skittish GSD would use and after trying many others, we found this one.  It is VERY sturdy looking, with raised sides, so my dog can find the edge and feel more secure.  She will go up this one, unlike most other ramps.  The raised ridges on the walking surface are great, no slipping or sliding, even with wet or snowy paws.  However, this thing weighs a ton!  It is very difficult to lift and carry and even though we have only had it a few months, mostly folded, lying flat in our semi-heated garage, it has warped!  We have only used it about a dozen times, at best, as our dog has been laid up with leg problems (that's why we need this).  We've only used it every couple of weeks to go to the vet.  Not sure why this is warping, but for now, it is still useable.  We also bought the half-sized version to go up two steps into the house and have had no problem with that version, just this one.  Very disappointed about the warping, don't like the weight (or higher price), but would probably buy this one again, as it is the ONLY one our dog feels sure-footed on and will use.  Not sure why a dog ramp needs to support 500 pounds, as no dog I've ever seen comes close to that!  (Have you?)  I think this ramp could be lighter in weight, with some different reinforcement underneath to keep it from warping.  And yes, you do need to be careful where you put your fingers when folding this ramp.  Hope this helps!\",\n",

I got 2 puppies 8 years ago and still have the SUVs - didn't want to damage their puppy legs so have used this right along every single day into their older years!

I have recommended this item to friends and they seem to think a ramp is  ramp.  Some of their ramps are too steep (short) for an SUV - some are too narrow for our 65 lb chows, and some get either slippery in the rain or hot in the summer.  And some are hard to put away.  This ramp doesn't have any of those limitations.  I am pleased with this purchase and hope you will be too.  And FYI - I paid about the same price 10 years ago!\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"First, let me say that I've only had this ramp for approximately one week, and normally I don't believe in posting reviews so quickly.  I planned to post a review of this product in about a month, but had to post this early in case it helped someone else in our situation with their dog.  So here is/was our situation.  Out of the blue one day while on vacation, my dog screamed in pain when walking up the 3 steps to our motorhome.  It was so heartbreaking and she ended up at a pet ER while we were traveling.  She was put on pain medication until we returned home.  After many unsuccessful vet visits,  it was determined by a specialist that our beagle has luxating patellas (kneecaps that pop out of joint).  She would always walk fine on level ground where no steps were involved.  So we had been carrying her inside her metal crate up and down our outside deck steps so she could do her thing!  A 25 lb. beagle AND a metal crate that has to weigh at least 15 lbs conservatively!  This had been going on since this past May when she experienced her first incident of obvious pain when going up steps.  I looked and researched many ramps, but this one was the only one made with a rubbery surface, although I think the entire ramp is some sort of plastic, but with incredibly good traction.  I did what another reviewer suggested, laid it flat on the floor inside of the house and within a day, with some coaxing and food, she easily walked back and forth over it that way.  Well, today, I decided to put it outside on the steps down to our patio, and didn't think she'd take to going down the ramp, much less up the ramp, right away.  Once again, food did the trick!  She didn't even hesitate, and walked down the ramp to retrieve the food, and back up again to retrieve the food, as my husband stood at one end, and I the other.  So in less than a week, she has really taken to it much more quickly than I expected.  So if anyone is on the fence about it, I highly recommend it, and the weather probably won't hurt it since it's made of hard plastic and rubber.  It has one little latch to fold it shut, but I just carry it sideways folded under my arm like a suitcase to move it if needed.  It will really prove to be a back saver for both my husband and myself!\",\n",

I have a Dodge Diesel 2500 pick up and they are quite tall. Diesel never wanted to go in by himself so that would leave me to hoist his large 80lb butt into the truck. Then after jumping down he would sometimes limp and was always very nervous about jumping out. So this ramp fixed all that. After receiving it I set it up into the truck and called him into the garage. He looked at it, grinned at me and up he went,then down,then up...you get the picture. I know this is not the correct way to train, but when Diesel's in the mood he catches on real quick. He loves rides so he is always impatient for me to set it up so he can get in the truck. But he does manage to wait with great distress. He climbs quickly up the ramp and I am happy that it has a non-slip surface that is permanent not stuck on, and the sides remind him not to step off. It fits ok on the lip of the underneath part of my truck seats if the seats are in the upright position. It's tight but it fits. This thing is heavy when you are trying to unfold it and hold onto a large puppy. The weight is the only downfall, but it's also what makes this sturdy and built so well. The pinch factor is always there too, but if it bends it goes to reason it can pinch you. Be careful and you should be fine. All in all it's a great ramp and remains sturdy while in use.\",\n",

I bought this and was impressed with the quality but I'm sending it back. Here's why. This thing is huge, 70x17 inches and weighs 22 lbs. Due to the weight and size you cannot easily fold it (pinched my fingers) then it takes up a lot of space in the rear of your vehicle. My Lab refused to walk on it which created a further training issue. I also purchased a dog crate for the back of my SUV which also had to be returned. Due to size restrictions of the vehicle my dog just barely fit in it. A good plan that fell apart.I found a solution. Purchased from Amazon was a luxury bench rear seat cover. It's a heavy duty quilted polyester water resistant non-slip cover for the rear seat. It has a hammock fitting option that totally covers the rear seat and back of the front seat area. The manufacturer is 4knines. Basically your dog is restricted to this one area containing the mess and hair and not destroying the rest of your car. It works. This product is fully washable. This is a viable option you may wish to consider.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"This ramp has pros and cons.  I used it for several months on my front steps (placed over 2 deep steps) with my 75lb. alaskan husky who has unsteady drooping hind legs due to a health condition.  It didn't work with my car, so I can't attest to using it for that purpose.Cons, first:-It's not really wide enough for a large dog with an unsteady gait (unless guided very carefully).  However, if you are a DIY'er and are placing this in one stationary spot, you could likely attach boards along the sides to prevent falling.  We had a few scary moments with this ramp because of the width and low sides.-The ridges are deep (deep enough that they really do prevent the dog from sliding down, but also made it uncomfortable for my dog to go up, as very uneven surfaces are hard for him to maneuver).  Wish the ridges were a bit more shallow, as the non-slip surface seems powerful on its own.-No bottom supports (not an issue for small dogs, but for larger dogs, the fact that there are no supports and is hinged in the middle means that there is some give when the dog walks on it - this made my dog a little nervous, but not enough that it would prevent me from purchasing it).  This is more of a FYI than a con.-I left mine in one spot, so this was irrelevant for me, but it is fairly heavy (this coming from a small-framed woman).Pros:-The rubber feet at the top seemed to hold well.-Folds for storage and transporting.-The rubberized non-slip surface is awesome!!!  I used it during the winter (and even regularly heated water in a tea kettle to pour over the surface for melting snow/ice) and it performed wonderfully.-This is superficial, but I love that it is khaki-colored, as it blended in better with my concrete steps and was less obvious than darker colored ones.Eventually I ended up building my own custom ramp, only because the ridges on this ramp were too deep for my dog.  If they had a slightly longer model with the same non-slip surface and shallower ridges, I would buy another in a heartbeat!\",\n",

She literally slipped and left scratched marks on it.  This one has ridges that are close together and the surface feels like a synthetic rubber.  I set it up and put a couple pieces of kibble at the top of the ramp set at a 45 degree angle and my 8 year old dog scrambled right up it, ate the kibble and laid down on it.  I had to tell her &#34;table&#34; to get her up and onto the table.

I don't need it to get her down but may try it to get her ready for the back of the SUV.  It is 2.5 pds heavier than the other and the sides are relatively thin plastic as opposed to the fiber glass with the telescoping one.

While this product has been a lifesaver, I'm currently looking for a lighter product that will work as well as this one.  If you have a suggestion, please leave me a comment.I use this ramp with a hatchback and for storage am able to stand it on its side against the door using a bungy cord to keep it upright.  This saves a lot of room and allows me to carry 3 large dogs in my hatchback with rear seats folded. I previously tried putting it behind front seat but it was awkward to get in and out with back seats folded down.On the plus side, the ramp is sturdy, easy to clean, and the dogs have had no problem using it.  I used the training instructions for my dog, but his companions were motivated just by dog bones.\",\n",

I wanted something that I could stand and walk on to show our dog that it could be trusted -- and sure enough, it is. Our dog isn' too old to require this, but I wanted to start using it as trying to teach some dogs to use ramps can be difficult (and the last thing I wanted to do was to teach him how to use it when he was injured). He isn't injured, but it took about 4 weeks to truly get him comfortable with using it. FYI, I always stand on it myself to make sure it's not wobbly or so the middle doesn't slightly buckle upwards (make sure the top part of the steps is FLAT as possible on the rim of the car/fender). It's a bit heavy, but it truly is solid and constructed well. Also, as others may have written, closing this must be done carefully.

And his legs were not able to handle that, so I had to lead him down the ramp by holding his collar so he wouldn\\'t try to jump off.  In the end, it was prostate cancer that did him in.

I can remove new ticks as easily as fed ones.The spoon, as I call it, is made of cheap plastic, but feels pretty sturdy since the plastic is fairly thick.

Low magnesium levels help to prevent urethra problems, especially in male cats due to their more narrow urethra.

He was certainly letting us know, so nobody was happy. (Of course, I was glad he let us knows and even happier when we got it worked out).Here's what we learned. Cat food has to have a balance of specific vitamins/minerals and if the amounts are out of whack, cats are very prone to urinary problems. We had switched to Spot's Stew, an &#34;all natural&#34; food, and it gave our little dude some major problems. Apparently Science Diet is one of the best companies for studying and developing formulas for urinary issues, and behold, we have had NO issues since switching.

However, as one reviewer pointed out, after they've been in the fridge they clan be a little harder to remove.  Running a little hot water over the lid while it's still on the can restores the flexibility and it will pop right off.  They're great.  I'm ordering more.\",\n",

This has seemed to help immensely, and they realize that if they're going to chew,we would much prefer that they go to their box rather than our couch or shoes.One product that we consistently stock in their toyboxes would be anything Nylabone. They are definitely durable, and while it is noticeable that they've been chewed, they don't shed chunks of plastic like other chewable type toys do - this gives me a huge peace of mind. The boys also really like the nubs, and will sometimes just sit there and nibble at them. They're both large breed dogs with very strong jaws (one is a Great Dane/Lab and the other is a Boxer/Rottweiler/Pitbull/Chow mix), and these have held up marvelously. Definitely recommended!\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I have a dog with very strong jaws. She's only thirty-five pounds but she goes through most toys like they're bubblegum. Even as a small puppy, she would destroy anything and everything. By the age of five or six months we had to give up on soft and rope toys altogether, and at a year old, she is limited to only hard chews like Kong, Nylabone, etc. Even then, she destroys most of these with relative ease. She's gone through chews others have recommended as long-lasting in literally ten minutes. The only toy she has that has lasted more than a month or so is her original red Kong, which she mostly licks instead of chews.I initially bought the dinosaur for my other, less toy-murderous dog, but the power chewer quickly stole it from him. She was in love. She carried it everywhere and chewed on it constantly. I'm not sure if it's the shape or the texture she likes, or some combination thereof, but whatever the case, it instantly became her favorite. Even the most durable hard toys normally only last a few weeks with her, but her dino is going on two or three months now. It's chewed beyond recognition, all the nubs worn down, and it's very rapidly nearing the end of its life because little bits of plastic are falling off, but it still lasted far longer than most toys do. A few weeks ago I bought her a second one, in a different shape, and she's equally as enamored with it. All in all, it's not going to be indestructible if you have a power chewer, but it certainly lasts a heck of a lot longer than most!\",\n",

I did read through the reviews prior to purchasing and was a little worried about my large dog breaking teeth and having dental problems as a results of this toy, however, I bought it anyways because he is not much of a real &#34;chewer&#34;. He's used to sharing his housemates toys and instead of chewing (and destroying the toys in one crunch), has learned to gently roll the toys around in his mouth and gently teethe on them. When the toy arrived, the large dog did his usual... only creating a few noticeable dents in the toy. The toy is, as previously mentioned by others, VERY hard that I'm surprised dogs even like to chew it. One time while the large dog was chewing it I did notice traces of blood on the toy and after a visual mouth inspection, concluded that he scraped his tongue. The smaller dogs have done more damage to this chew toy to the point where there are many jagged, sharp edges where they continue to chew. Any mark that is made into the toy creates these sharp edges and then hair/lint/carpet gets caught in it. If you have occasional chewers, this wouldn't be a bad purchase. If you have regular, or aggressive chewers though, I would not recommend this toy. It would not last long and I would worry about small, sharp pieces breaking off and being ingested.\",\n",
